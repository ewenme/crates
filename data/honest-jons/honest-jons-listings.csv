Ray Charles,The Genius Sings The Blues,Atlantic,"A lucky seven of Ray Charles’ classic Atlantic LPs meticulously reissued by Rhino (amidst a sea of bootlegs). All kicking mono, 180g vinyl, with the iconic artwork properly buffed up.
If you get just one to start with, we’d recommend this, gathering together his bluesier cuts for the label, at the end of his stay.
The almighty, pitch-dark I Believe To My Soul is here, for example. Everybody needs a copy handy for emergencies.
‘Last night you were dreaming and I heard you say “Oh, Johnny”, when you know my name is Ray. That’s why I believe right now (I believe, yes, I believe), I say I believe right now (I believe, yes, I believe), well, I believe to my soul now… You’re tryin’ to make a fool of me.

Chicago Slickers,1948-1953,Nighthawk,"‘Sixteen classic recordings from Chicago’s heyday as a blues centre’; sides by the likes of Little Walter and Homesick James, on lost labels like Parkway, Tempotone and Random. 
‘Once I had a woman who treat me nice and kind / but these Chicago slickers made my baby change her mind.’
Stuffed with killers, but Johnny Shines’ Ramblin’ is downright unmissable.",Blues
Chicago Slickers,Volume 2: 1948-1955,Nighthawk,"A second volume of ‘the best and rarest Chicago blues of the early postwar era.’ Little Walter, Muddy Waters, Sunnyland Slim, Floyd Jones, Snoooky Pryor, Roosevelt Sykes… all present and correct. 
You need it for Johnny Shines’ Living In The White House, about setting society to rights, over the rocking saxophone of J.T. Brown. ‘I want to live in paradise, make servants out of kings and queens / Now don’t shake me please darlin / This is one time I want to finish my dream.’",Blues
Christians Catch Hell,"Gospel Roots, 1976-79",Honest Jon's Records,"Utterly magnificent, sublimely soulful survey of the Gospel Roots label, subsidiary of the mighty TK Records at the height of the Miami Sound.
A&R was co-ordinated by Gospel legends Ira Tucker — from the Dixie Hummingbirds — and Ralph Bass, veteran producer with Savoy, King and Chess. The label was run by Timmy Thomas, who had recently smashed with Why Can’t We Live Together, for another TK spin-off, Glades. Operations were overseen by Henry Stone himself, unlikely King of Disco, who had recorded a young Ray Charles, and pushed forward James Brown. They drew in artists from all over the US, from St. Louis, Columbus, Memphis, Brooklyn, Cabrini Green in Chicago: unknowns like Camille Doughty, reluctant to jeopardise her job at GM (‘Generous Motors’) in Detroit, and huge-sellers like the revered Brooklyn All Stars, who started out on Peacock in 1958. 
Choral belters, deep ballads, harmony quartets, epic city-blues, gritty funk, powerhouse female soul… Killer-diller Philly like a scorching version of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes’ Wake Up Everybody; and Jean Austin’s raw Spirit Free, co-written by Ronnie Dyson, produced by Jesse James at Future Gold. Chicago Sound like The Fantastic Family Aires — named after the family’s furniture store on North Cicero, but reminiscent of the Staple Singers at their best — through to the full-blown glory of The Fountain Of Life Joy Choir, led by Marvin Yancy from The Independents, and featuring Natalie Cole… Singers like Versie Mae Gibson, from the Jordans, by rights up there with Irma, Etta and Ree… Bangers 100%-guaranteed to find their way into Theo Parrish sets; and mortal delirium for the prissiest of soul and gospel purists.
Beautifully presented… the LPs with a 12”-square, full-colour, sixteen-page album of photos and original artwork, the CD with a forty-page booklet — and truly outstanding notes, including insightful new interviews across the board; mastered at Abbey Road.
Dread and civitas, for Christmas; grit and transcendence.",Blues

The title track is slippery, acid-flecked house, while the floating rhythms and space-shuttle chatter of State Function evoke early-nineties Sputnik missions. The grooving hand-percussion and celestial pads of Mary Lynne and the spaced-out Chi-Motion are primed for the chill-out room, or any place where there’s a lava lamp and a beanbag. All told this is rich, space-age techno to take your dance floor somewhere in the past that feels like the future.’",Dance

Even in their delirium, b-boys and girls will savour traces of the Incredible Bongo Band, in the chorus.

Insanlar / Ricardo Villalobos,Kime Ne,Honest Jon's Records,"Stunning new music from Istanbul! 
A twenty-four-minute wig-out you can dance to — wild baglama improvisation and mystical male-unison singing, atop the propulsive mass of a Berlin half-stepper, with turbulent detours into dub, radiophonics and psychedelia.
‘Kime Ne’ means ‘so what’, ‘what’s it got to do with you’. The song adapts verses from the seventeenth-century poet Kul Nesimi, wistfully invoking the Melami strain of Sufism as a touchstone of humility and tolerance, in dark times. ‘Insanlar’ means ‘humankind’... ‘The Human Beings’.
RV’s mixes are expert, taut and hard-grooving. 2 is the more agitated and dubwise.

Jabu,Sleep Heavy,Blackest Ever Black,"‘Broken-hearted, downtempo r&b/street-soul and atmospheric, introspective electronics from singers Alex Rendall and Jasmine Butt, and producer Amos Childs. It’s a future Bristol classic with a universal resonance, with songs that are highly personal but deeply relatable, and tripped-out… Childs is one of the most gifted producers of his generation and his work here, grounded in hip-hop but floating free, is a thing of sustained wonder: crepuscular, melancholic – funereal, at times — subtly psychedelic and heavily dubwise, but always concise and purposeful, with influences from US R&B to Japanese art-pop minimalism, and a rich seam of underground UK soul, boogie, DIY/post-punk, library music and lovers rock.’ 
Now and again a bit cloying and confected, trip-hop and scandi-noir, it has to be said, and the label’s likening of Rendall’s singing to Teddy Pendergrass and The Temptations is way overcooked — more like a cross between Bryan Ferry and The Associates’ Billy Mackenzie — but surely this is one of the records of the year.",Dance

Kassem Mosse,Disclosure,Honest Jon's Records,"Fierce, subtle music, radically strange and unafraid of the deep, but with a killer understanding of rhythm. Lush drum-machine nocturnes, gnarly electronica and glorious flowerings of zoned-out dubspace: an evolutionary music, continuously engaged with experimentation both in the studio and the club.
Whether prepared solo, or jointly with his spar Mix Mup, a Kassem Mosse recording is less of a stand-alone creation than the next thrilling installment of an unstoppable groove. True to form, Disclosure dazzlingly extends some of the most mystical, essential dancefloor-rooted music of the last decade, from dusty, dream-state techno on Workshop and Mikrodisko, to frazzled beatdowns on Trilogy Tapes and Nonplus.
Pedigree techno and house are the lifeblood of Disclosure, yet with something newly microscopic about them. Its mesmerising juggle of pointillistic percussion, melting-wax chords and fleshy bump’n’grind suggests biological processes at work, as if Mosse has zoomed right into the cellular metabolism ticking away at the core of the music.
These textures are woven into some of KM’s richest and most emotionally complex material so far, constantly enlivened by forays into jazz, dub and beyond. Check the farty-bottom, broken-down, steel-pan minimalism of Collapsing Dual Core, just the job for coursing around Detroit in a car at night; and Phoenicia Wireless’ dastardly, intricate combination of glowering John Carpenter synths, heavy static and junked consoles on remote, as if the beats are fighting a wave of dirt, soot and fossilisation. The frantic, interstella tarantella of Galaxy Series 7; the wonky bump-and-hustle and heavy-lidded drama of Purple Graphene, to close. 
Expertly pieced-together and paced, Disclosure brilliantly registers all the self-contained coherence and artistic authority of an album proper, yet shadowed throughout by the open-ended and questing spirit so vital to Mosse’s music. Its intimate enactments of non-closure, and its sense that anything could happen at any moment; its thematic play between excess and incompleteness, babble and tongue-tied stutter, and-you-don’t-stop grooving and entropy, wobble and the pause-button.
Trash and ready in a spiffy Bankhead sleeve, too.
Double bim. Bim, bim.",Dance
Kassem Mosse,Chilazon,Honest Jon's Records,"Pure worries from Leipzig — three club burners steeped in Detroit traditions, distilling the explorations in collective, nervy hypnosis of KM live sets. As the music slowly unfurls, there he is at every turn, subtly tweaking its parameters, redistributing its weight, pricking its grooves into a state of utterly infectious perpetual movement.
The two visions of Chilazon track opposite pathways: the first is twelve minutes of gorgeous, dubwise, aquatic techno, spattered with kicks and razor-sharp hi-hats, and smeared with ghostly echoes; then a terse mesh of broken drums, escalating to a quiet yet feverishly intense peak. Lanthanum is calligraphic swordplay, its toms and bass stabs warily circling one another in a graceful steppers’ dance, spaced-out and fathoms-deep.",Dance

Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force,Walo Walo Version,Ndagga,"Three killers heralding the next phase of this dazzling expression of a dream Dakar-Berlin nexus. All instrumental — though the opener has snatches of singing — with the vocal versions held back for the new album. 
The music just gets deadlier and deadlier — harder-boiled and deeper; more focussed, confident and dubwise.
Evoking the ancient cultural legacy of the griots, ‘Walo Walo’ is also the name of the sabar rhythm underlying the opener, which features Ibou Mbaye’s percussive synth-work, Mangone Ndiaye Dieng’s kit-drumming, and Bada Seck’s rigorous jolts of lower-pitched Thiol drum. The ‘Groove’ version is tough as nails; well and truly gnarly.
A tribute to the Baye Fall leader, Ndiguel Groove is a sparse, mellow interpretation of the most traditional cut on the album, showcasing Assane Ndoye Cisse’s insinuating guitar lines, Laye Lo’s super-elasticated snare-drumming, and Bada Seck playing the khine drums associated with the Baye Fall. (Short and wide; lightweight but low-pitched.)

Loose-leaved but balanced, lucid and intimate, it sets out from stunning a cappella and virtuosic komuz and kylak, mouth harp and traditional percussion: not field, but expert studio recordings, using marvellous vintage microphones, made over several days in Berlin. Further, a few of these are deftly treated by Moritz, using Reichian de-synced double-tracking, and discreet effects. Also two ten-minute dubs: a deadly, signature Berlin steppers, plus its version; and an echoing, mystical drum session, recorded live on stage in Bishkek. And a side-long, dream-like summation: the locomotive, oceanic, clangorous, dread Facets.

Nuel,Unveiled,Latency,"A stone scorcher of an EP to put alongside his classic Aquaplanos with Donato Dozzy, from nearly ten years ago. 
Four contrasting, deeply atmospheric stages in longing — swingeing and propulsive to blissed-out and bittersweet. Terse but charged; hypnotic, never bludgeoning; soulful and warmly crafted, never mechanical.
Says Nuel — ‘Unveiled consists of live recordings made on the same great day: 03/10/2015. The inspiration comes from a woman, the record is my reaction to something she unveiled. The record is about really strong feelings, relationships and mental projections… a sexy record for me. After that recording session I found these tracks so appealing that I decided to keep them in that form, a document of that day.’
In hand-made, silk-screened sleeves — tastily inky and rough — featuring a bust from the gardens of the Villa Medici in Rome… stern, erect, gaze averted.

But even at its most angst-ridden it feels lithe and aerodynamic, its darker impulses both intensified, and offset, by a pure soundboy’s delight in detail and colour and higher dancefloor mechanics. The music pulses with energy, a fever to communicate… and Raki Singh (violin), Jasmine (vocals) and Ollie Moore (saxophone) add vivid flesh-tone to the punishing, plasmic electronics.’",Dance

At times it feels like the missing link between British Murder Boys and Source Direct, or what might have happened if late 90s UK junglists had listened more closely to Chain Reaction. But really, it sounds like Pessimist and Pessimist alone. The ruthless minimalism, and the tension which comes of that restraint; the swing and propulsion of the drum programming; the abyssal reverbs and long trails of delay; the deep and body-numbing sub-bass; the uncompromising palette of blacks and blues…’",Dance

Shackleton & Vengeance Tenfold,Sferic Ghost Transmits,Honest Jon's Records,"No-one else makes music like this: devilishly complex but warm and intuitive, stirring together a dizzying assembly of outernational and outerspace influences, whilst retaining the subby funk-and-hot-breath pressure of Shackleton’s soundboy, club roots. 
The result is an evolutionary, truly alchemical music — great shifting tides of dub, minimalist composition and choral song (Five Demiurgic Options); ritual spells to ward off the darkness (Before The Dam Broke, The Prophet Sequence); radiophonia and zoned-out guitar improv (Seven Virgins); even the febrile, freeform psychedelia of eighties noise rock (Sferic Ghost Transmits / Fear The Crown).
Over the five years since Music For The Quiet Hour, Vengeance’s vocal and lyrical range has rolled out across this new terrain. Throughout these six transmissions he’s hoarse preacher, sage scholar and ravaged bluesman; blind man marching off to war, and exhausted time-traveller warning of impending socio-ecological catastrophe. 
Six dialogic accounts of our conflicted times, then, expanding beyond the treacly unease of the duo’s early collaborative work into something subtler and more emotionally shattering — its shades of brightness more dazzling, and its darkness even murkier.
“We almost didn’t hear it when the foundations went.”",Dance
Shackleton With Anika,Behind The Glass,Woe To The Septic Heart,NA,Dance
Shackleton With Ernesto Tomasini,Devotional Songs,Honest Jon's Records,"Shackleton’s most expansive, ecstatic and hallucinatory music to date. Four extended excursions channeling Congotronics way to the east, with an aura of restrained mania reminiscent of the feral pomp and gallows humour of Coil’s moon-musick phase.
The pairing with Tomasini is a match made in heaven. Swooping from deep growl to piercing falsetto, his four-octave voice both heightens the taste for the theatrical that’s always been integral to Shackleton’s music, and makes explicit the latter’s kinship to the occult energies of the UK’s post-industrial underground.
As the title suggests, these are shadowy songs rich with allusions to bodily ritual and psychic exploration, with Tomasini’s lyrics framed by luminous whirls of hand-struck drums and synthetic gamelan, bells and tumbling organ melodies, all earthed by dubwise bass. You Are The One escalates from delicate choral chant to full-bore psychedelic organ freakout; Rinse Out All Contaminants is a slow incantation, to purge all negative thoughts; the melodies of Father You Have Left Me are smudged like early Steve Reich, then burned out by snarling subs; and the magnificent Twelve Shared Addictions balances elliptical melodies like spinning plates, gradually unfurling into a breakneck storm of voice and hammered keys.",Dance

Each side spins the wheel and introduces a new collaborator or two — Phillip Lauer from Tuff City Kids is here; Gilb’r from Versatile (on a new version of Pulehouse)... 
The knockout punch is there on side three: Nondo — which means ‘Heaven’, ‘Eternity’ — starts out as an electro-lullaby from Côte d’Ivoire, sotto voce and abuzz, before lifting off as a zinging, anthemic, future-house-classic.

Just over fifteen minutes long, Mabomba Dance gradually layers Mutua’s needle-sharp percussion over a deep analogue bass pulse, building into a hypnotic dancefloor workout.
The flip showcases the Nyatiti harp of Nyatrapasa, before delving into a kind of minimalist Afrobeat. Traditional Nubian percussion and Mekha’s stellar vocals draw the EP to a close.",Dance

Elizabeth Cotten,Vol. 2: Shake Sugaree,Smithsonian Folkways Recordings,"From age seven EC taught herself to play cornshuckin’ country-rag-time on her brother’s banjo (whilst he was out). At eleven she bought herself a guitar, and again she taught herself, left-handedly holding it upside-down, mostly open-tuned, playing syncopated bass with her fingers and melody with her thumb — ‘cotten-picking’ it like a banjo. Having given up music for church and family, forty years later she found work in the musical household of composer Ruth Crawford Seeger (a Joanna Newsom favourite), and re-learned. 
There are wonderful instrumentals here, including three from church — but, covered by the likes of Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead, the original Shake Sugaree is singularly sublime and unmissable. Co-written with her young grand-children, it’s both lulling near-nonsense and devastatingly poignant, with deadly measures of regret and longing, innocence and debauchery. (Twelve-year-old Brenda’s pawned everything she can lay her hands on, and raised Cain with the proceeds; now she’s ‘going to heaven in a brown pea shell’. Still — listen — she can’t bring herself to sing the word ‘hell’.)",Folk

Larry Jon Wilson,Let Me Sing My Song To You,Be With Records,"‘His LP debut New Beginnings failed to propel Larry Jon to even the relatively modest cult acclaim enjoyed by his like-minded contemporaries.

Rob Noyes,The Feudal Spirit,Poon Village,"‘Rob Noyes from eastern Massachussetts sometimes seems to have absorbed an almost infinite reservoir of influences. Apart from some superb Basho-like 12-string tunneling, most momentary fragments tend to recall legendary Limeys like John Renbourn (and through him, Davey Graham), because Rob’s overt melodic structures tend towards the non-bluesoid. But then you’ll maybe hear a note-sequence spiced like something dropped from the hot strings of Michael Chapman or even a powerful throng that makes you think of Wizz Jones. When that happens, you realize there’s more of a blues base to some of the songs than you’d been able to untangle. Mr. Noyes hits a vast array of sub-genres on this album, and he hits them all pretty damn hard. Rob’s playing carries the weight of many possibly-imaginary forebears, but the way he smears them all together shows a holistic mastery of touch and imagination that defies a lot of today’s players, who tend to shine in short bursts, then allow their dreams to outrun their technique’ (Byron Coley).",Folk

So it was that when A&M’s Burrito Brothers debut The Gilded Palace of Sin made it to shelves in February of 1969, early adherents to the Cosmic American gospel were already echoing its message from areas flanking Gram Parsons’ Southern California hills and canyons. There was F.J. McMahon in coastal Santa Barbara, Mistress Mary further inland in Hacienda Heights, and Plain Jane of Albuquerque, New Mexico…’",Folk

Long out-of-print; pressed at Pallas.
“We played all over Europe,” remembered Bowie. “Our situation in Europe was completely unique among groups; the way we carried ourselves, the way we conducted our business. Most cats were in the regular jazz thing: you come, get a hotel room, and blah blah blah. But we had children, a dog; we lived in the country. It was unusual because most of the jazz cats were sitting around Paris, and we had a nice big estate, cherry trees and apple trees, ha… instead of squandering our money, we would collectively get together and buy things that the group needed— instruments and equipment. We had a Volkswagen, and we bought two more trucks over there… We could travel anywhere, and this is mostly, I think, the reason we were so successful. We could be hired for Germany; all we had to do was pack and come over, whereas to a lot of groups it would have meant trains and planes. We spent the whole summer of 1970 just traveling. We did radio and TV concerts all over.”",Jazz

Derek Bailey,Solo Guitar Volume 1,Honest Jon's Records,"Kicking off a series of collaborations between Honest Jon’s and Incus: three double LPs of the legendary free-improvising guitarist Derek Bailey, solo and in duos with Anthony Braxton and Han Bennink, augmenting the original releases with marvellous, previously unissued music. As throughout the series, the recordings are newly transferred from tape at Abbey Road, and re-mastered by Rashad Becker. The records are manufactured by Pallas.",Jazz
Derek Bailey,Aida,Honest Jon's Records,"At last, the vinyl reissue of this masterwork, adding two hitherto unreleased gems recorded solo for Charles Fox’s Radio 3 programme Jazz in Britain, in the same few months of 1980 as the stunning Aida performances.
The phrase ‘in the moment’ is often bandied about with reference to free improvisation, and indeed there’s no better way to describe Derek Bailey’s playing. The acoustic guitar is notoriously lacking in natural reverberation — notes barely hang in the air for a couple of seconds before they disappear — which explains the almost non-stop flow of new material in these stellar performances.  Bailey knew from one split-second to the next exactly where to find the same pitch on different strings, either as a stopped tone or a ringing harmonic, and there’s never a note out of place. ‘He who kisses the joy as it flies,’ in the words of William Blake, ‘Lives in eternity’s sunrise’ — and this music is forever in the moment, constantly active but never gabby, kissing the joy.
One of the special pleasures of the BBC set is the guitarist’s own laconic commentary, a deliciously deadpan description of what he’s doing while he’s doing it — “I like to think of it… as a kind of music” — and the interaction between words and music is a particular delight. “You may have noticed a certain lack of variety,” he quips, while unleashing a furiously complex volley. Is it a coincidence that the final seconds recall the famous cycling fifths of the coda to Thelonious Monk’s Round Midnight? Surely not — for Bailey, like Monk, was a note man par excellence. And they’re both still alive and well in eternity’s sunrise.",Jazz
Derek Bailey,Lot 74,Honest Jon's Records,"This iconic LP was originally released by Incus in 1974. Recorded at a private house in Catford, south-east London, the side-long title track is a masterwork: a twenty-two-minute, starkly personal, freely expressive, itchily searching re-casting of orders of rhythm and sound into a new, quicksilver kind of affective and musical polyphony. Never mind the guitarist’s championing of ‘non-idiomatic improvisation’, the poet Peter Riley gets the ball rolling in his identification of the various hauntings of Bailey’s playing at this time: ‘mandolins & balalaikas strumming in the distance, George Formby’s banjo, Leadbelly’s steel 12-string, koto, lute, classical guitar… and others quite outside the field of the plucked string.’ 
The five pieces on side two were recorded back home in Hackney around the same time — with the exception of Improvisation 104(b), from the year before (and issued by Incus in its TAPS series of mini reel-to-reel tapes) — opening with ventriloquised guitar feedback, and taking in some cod banter about colleagues like Mervyn Parker, Siegfried Brotzmann and Harry Bentink. 
Crucial.",Jazz
Derek Bailey & Han Bennink,,Honest Jon's Records,"The tussling vegetables in Mal Dean’s cover-sketch somehow befit perfectly this extraordinary duo of Bailey and the great Dutch drummer Han Bennink. Recorded in London in 1972, Incus 9 was their second record (after an ICP in 1969), becoming a blueprint and inspiration for generations of free-improvisers. It is paired here with a brilliant session from the following year, with the same power and friendly combativeness, and oodles of creativity, technique and humour. It’s obvious how much they loved playing together.",Jazz

"Derek Bailey, Tristan Honsinger",Duo,Honest Jon's Records,"Born in Burlington, Vermont, and conservatory-trained in the US, the cellist Tristan Honsinger moved from Montreal to Amsterdam in 1974, quickly linking with Han Bennink and Misha Mengelberg, and opening a long and fruitful musical relationship with Derek Bailey. Recorded in 1976, Duo displays a performative musical approach already characterised by the lack of inhibition which would later endear him to The Pop Group: he is knockabout, exclamatory, explosively rhythmic; burping Bach and folk melodies with spasmodic lyricism, in amongst the garrulous textures and accents of his scraping, bowing and plucking, and gibbering like a monkey; throwing out his arms and stamping the floor, grappling with his instrument like an expert clown, always on the lookout for new ways to trip himself up. You can hear Bailey revelling in the company, as he ranges between scrabbling solidarity and an askance skewering of his partner’s antics, on prepared (nineteen-string) and standard electric guitars — and a Waisvisz Crackle-box, for the garbled, quizzical, cross-species natter which closes The Shadow. Throughout, the spirited interplay between laconic, analytic wit and guttural, sometimes slapstick physicality is consistently droll, often laugh-out-loud funny; vigorously alert, alive and gripping.",Jazz

Derek Bailey & Jamie Muir,Dart Drug,Honest Jon's Records,"Percussionist Jamie Muir was a member of King Crimson during the recording of Larks’ Tongues In Aspic, in 1973. Staying less than a year with Robert Fripp, the Scot had already cut his teeth with another master guitarist, Derek Bailey, as part of the Music Improvisation Company, along with Evan Parker, Hugh Davies and Christine Jeffrey, whose eponymous 1970 album was one of the first releases on ECM. Muir and Bailey recorded Dart Drug eleven years later, in 1981.
There’s no shortage of great percussionists in the brief history of free improvised music but on the strength of Dart Drug alone Jamie Muir deserves a place at High Table. Unlike for example Han Bennink and John Stevens, though, you can’t hear echoes of any particular jazz drummer in Muir’s playing, even if he has expressed appreciation for Milford Graves (who himself sounded like nobody else who’d come before him).
What on earth did Muir’s kit consist of? Some instruments are clearly identifiable (bells, gongs, chimes, woodblocks); others could be… well, anything. Old suitcases thwacked with rolled up newspapers? Tin cans and hubcaps inside a washing machine? Who cares? It sounds terrific – but if you’re the kind of person who faints at the sound of nails scraping a blackboard, you might want to nip out and put the kettle on towards the end of the title track.
Dart Drug is consistently thrilling, and often very amusing – but it’s certainly not easy listening. In music we talk about playing with other musicians, whereas in sport you play against another opponent (or with your team against another team). Why not play against in music, too? That’s precisely what happens very often in improvised music, and Bailey was particularly good at it. How can a humble acoustic guitar hope to compete with a Muir in full flight?  Sometimes Bailey’s content to sit on those open strings, teasing out yet another exquisite Webernian constellation of ringing harmonics and wait for the dust to settle in Muir’s junkyard, but elsewhere he sets off into uncharted territory himself.
“The way to discover the undiscovered in performing terms is to immediately reject all situations as you identify them (the cloud of unknowing) – which is to give music a future.” Bailey evidently concurred with this spoken statement by Muir, including it in his book Improvisation.
Derek Bailey is no longer with us, of course, and Muir gave up performing music back in 1989. All the more reason for seeking out this magnificent, wild album.",Jazz

Barney Wilen,Moshi,Souffle Continu,"Inspired, free, luminous music-making. An outernational holy grail and a stiff tonic for all citizens of nowhere. 
Already the great French jazz saxophonist had made monumental records alongside all-time legends like Monk, Blakey, Bud Powell and Miles — that’s Wilen on Lift To The Scaffold — before cutting loose at the end of the sixties on a two-year journey through Morocco, Algeria, Niger, Mali, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Senegal, with a team of film-makers, technicians and musicians. 
Moshi means trance utterance — the moshi is a demon invoked by the Fulani Borogi of Niger, to chase away angst and depression — and this is a shamanistic bricolage of smoky musical spells and scraps of intimate, outdoors ambience, full of love, good vibes and gritty musical wonder, drawn from more than fifty tape reels recorded en route: desert blues, space-jazz, street-funk, acid rock, polyphonic rhythms and new-thing influences like Shepp and Sanders; buzzing, extended ensemble sessions, like alternative Bitches Brews, crossed with diverse snippets of magic grabbed on the wing, like Algerian gnawa, or solo mbira, or just people laughing together, or a Bamako griot…

Bayou Maharajah,The Life And Music Of New Orleans Piano Legend James Booker,Cadiz Music,"Unmissable film! 
A rawly soulful, moving tribute to the out-of-this-world artistry of James Carroll Booker, with dazzling clips of him in performance, various compelling interviews with his inner circle — where celebration and awe are cut with bitter frustration — and beautifully judged footage of the New Orleans locale.
In his autobiography, Queen Of The Junkers Joo Joo, Booker wrote: ‘It never occurred to me, until the age of four or five, that I was not a female, plus equipped to talk. The first woman I wanted to marry without doing it against my will was actually Tallulah Bankhead and another chick was a dude who identified herself as the Toast, the muffin or the Footloose Fancy Fruitcake among other commodities. Since then I heard she has not yet entered the Unorthodox Book of the almost Living.’ 
Booker liked dressing up as a woman called Juanita; he got nicked for impersonating plod. He did a stretch in Angola State Penitentiary, for drugs. He told people that Ringo Starr put his eye out, in a fight. He was way larger than life; just like his stunning piano-playing never shuts down into either ragtime or jazz, blues or classical (especially Chopin), and his singing is free as a bird.
Booker was born in 1939, around the time Jelly Roll Morton died (as he liked to note). Aged fourteen, his first recording under his own name was Doing The Hambone, for Dave Bartholomew. That’s really him playing piano on a bunch of Fats Domino and Little Richard records. He accompanied everyone from Bobby Bland, to Ray Charles, to Aretha. Amongst scores of 45s, his 1960 organ instrumental Gonzo — named after a mythical smack addict — was Hunter Thompson’s theme-song, and a smash for Peacock. Dr. John called Booker ‘the best black, gay, one-eyed junkie piano genius New Orleans has ever produced’ (which is faint praise).     
Big Easy portions of staggering, utter musical genius, sexual transgressiveness, drugs and booze, suffering, waste and mania. 
James Booker… such a don.

Reviews seem unanimous that it’s the best yet.
‘Characteristically action-packed in the Berne tradition (following on from AACM and his muse Julius Hemphill): powerful, dynamic, often fast-moving  — yet also very clear in all its teeming detail. “We somehow achieved more sonic space by adding another player,” says Berne. It’s an impression maintained even when producer David Torn takes up his own guitar in a cameo at the climax of the modestly-titled Sideshow (in reality a 26-minute epic journey), soloing amid thunderous timpani, over a serpentine melody outlined by sax and clarinet.’",Jazz

This 1998 album is magisterial, showcasing Bey’s four-octave baritone/falsetto range pushed to its expressive limits. The compositions are dazzlingly diverse, opening and closing with the caressing intimacies of a Brazilian love-song and an Afro-Cuban lullaby, by way of Midnight Blue, a Monk and an Ellington, and the modal classic Half And Half; a knockout version of the beautiful song Some Other Time; a staggering excursion on Blood Count; and a gently rocking interpretation of Nick Drake’s River Man.

Bheki Mseleku,Celebration,Matsuli,"The story goes that Alice Coltrane gave her late husband’s saxophone mouthpiece to Bheki, recognising in the South African pianist ‘a kindred spirit to John Coltrane.’ 
His first release under his own name, Celebration was recorded and produced by World Circuit, who originally issued it on compact disc and cassette in 1992. 
Roiling with an historical sense of transition and upheaval, the sessions brought together musicians from SA, London and the US in the same months as the dismantling of apartheid, as if to put in lights the accession of South Africa to the to-and-fro of Black Atlantic culture. Counterposed to the album’s disclosure of the personal toll of exile, its evocations of inner peace and transendence are unmistakably marked by Trane and Pharoah Sanders, but elsewhere European classical forms and township marabi and mbhaqanga come to the fore.
‘The first thing that struck me about this album was the feeling of the music,’ says Shabaka Hutchings. ‘It had so much joy. It felt like it was so much more than the intricacies of how he was creating the music; it invoked the feeling of why this music was being made.’",Jazz

Marion Brown,Three For Shepp,Superior Viaduct,"‘In 1966, when Marion Brown was ready to make his first record as a leader, he was standing on the shoulders of giants. Formative associations with Ornette Coleman and Sun Ra established Brown as a saxophonist to watch, and he had already appeared on free jazz landmarks Archie Shepp’s Fire Music and John Coltrane’s Ascension. Originally released on Impulse!, Brown’s debut lays down three startling originals and three tunes by Shepp — echoing his mentor’s 1964 homage to Coltrane, Four For Trane. Featuring Grachan Moncur III on trombone, Dave Burrell on piano and Sirone on bass, Three for Shepp balances fiery energy and delicate precision. Side A showcases Brown compositions that mix modal structures with ecstatic playing, particularly when the bandleader chases Moncur and Burrell on the exhilarating ‘The Shadow Knows.’ On the album’s all-Shepp side, ‘West India’ draws inspiration from India and Africa, while the feverish post-bop of ‘Delicado’ demonstrates the band’s versatility, swept by the wheeling drums of Beaver Harris. Even this early in his career, Brown stood apart from his peers in ‘the new thing.’ His solos were as gentle as they were furious. Informed by the African American folk traditions of his native Georgia and an enthusiastic embrace of the avant-garde, his music would confront and challenge society. As Brown says in the original liner notes, ‘The music is definitely a part of what’s going on in the black revolution in America.’ Three for Shepp still sounds crucial today (over fifty years later) and remains a vital statement of jazz’s past, present and future.’",Jazz

Cecil Payne,Zodiac,Strata-East,"CP came through professionally in the 1940s, most notably with Dizzy Gillespie. Amongst scores of recordings, he’s on Randy Weston’s Uhuru Afrika, Kenny Dorham’s Afro Cuban, and Baritones And French Horns, with Trane. Here, leading a seriously distinguished lineup — Dorham, Albert Kuumba Heath, Wynton Kelly and Wilbur Ware, produced by Clifford Jordan — he naturally brings his own retrospective gravitas to the late-sixtes jazz ferment, underlined by his opening each side here with tributes: Martin Luther King, with its strongly Milesian lines, and Slide Hampton, featuring some scintillating piano work. Both Dorham and Kelly died between the recording and release of this album — which honours Eric Dolphy, also recently deceased — and the music itself poignantly hinges together different eras in jazz, proposing new paths forward in the tight funk of Girl, You Got A Home, and rollicking Carib jazz of Flying Fish, to close.

Here is his own trio, recording in 1976, back in Trinidad. Top-notch jazz piano playing, bluesy and spontaneous, imbued with folk and calypso rhythms (and including tunes by Kitch and Sparrow), with dashes of Latin and funk, and hefty bass. Worth sticking around for the lovely closer, Ogun.",Jazz

“We wanted to avoid that kind of ‘free’ which is characterized by pounding drumming and a saxophonist freaking out in the high register, that type of music that kicks off suddenly then stops without us being able to sense the motivation. There is never any difference in intensity: nothing is destroyed, nothing is created, nothing is elaborated, nothing is questioned — when, even on the simple level of sound, there is so much that can be done.”
With French roots running back through the music of Jef Gilson, and pitched at the time somewhere between ESP and Actuel/BYG, with full-blooded nods to the likes of Cecil Taylor, John Coltrane and Walt Dickerson, this is expert, exuberant music-making, searching out its own way.

The production is astounding, the quality of improvisation is riveting, the string arrangements are apocalyptic rather than saccharine, the balance of turbulence and calm a genuine dialectic that later mystic/exotic post-jazz copped out of pursuing. Her lack of constraint was dimly regarded by adherents of ‘70s jazz and its masculine orthodoxies, yet Alice deserved better credit for virtuosity, originality, and the sheer will power needed to realize her vision.’",Jazz

Derek Bailey & Cyro Baptista,Cyro,Honest Jon's Records,"When Cyro Baptista moved to New York in 1980 from his home city of São Paulo, he brought with him an arsenal of percussion instruments, including the cuica (friction drum), surdo (the booming bass drum associated with samba), berimbau (single-string bow with resonating gourd), and cabasas galore, in the next few years deploying them most notably in numerous ensembles curated by John Zorn, who helped set up this studio session in 1982.
As you might expect from someone whose infectious grooves have graced the work of Herbie Hancock, Astrud Gilberto and Cassandra Wilson, Baptista expertly fires off cunning polyrhythms, even traces of thumping samba, with restless fluency. Bailey the wily old fox skirts and eschews the bait, which is quickly conjured away and newly fashioned. The guitarist homes in on the delicious squeaks of the cuica and the twanging drones of the berimbau with truly awesome tonal precision. You could sing along if you wanted, after a caipirinha or two. And he gets almost as many different sounds from his instrument as Baptista can from his kit – check out the stratospheric plings and string-length fret-sweeps of Tonto, which sound more like a prepared piano than an acoustic guitar. 
Wonders abound, from the berimbau/bent-string exchanges that open Quanto Tempo to the delightful collision of howling cuica and spiky bebop on Polvo, and the spare, preposterous Webernian samba of Improvisation 3.
These days, ‘improvisation’ often appears without its customary qualifier ‘free’. If there were ever a case to be made for its reinstatement, this album is the best supporting evidence. Freedom means you’re free to get into the groove, free not to, free to play with each other, free to play against each other. Sometimes frustrating, even scary, but more often than not in the hands of these two great masters it’s hilarious, exhilarating and utterly irresistible.",Jazz
Derek Bailey & Tony Coe,Time,Honest Jon's Records,"Multi-reedist Tony Coe was born in 1934, four years after guitarist Derek Bailey. He cut his teeth as a career jazzman with Humphrey Lyttleton, before an extended stint with the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band. On this rare 1979 duo outing, he sticks to clarinet. And though that instrument has an illustrious jazz pedigree, Coe’s playing here is something else.
It’s worth noting that the clarinettist has also played under the baton of arch-modernist Pierre Boulez, the kind of composer Derek Bailey enjoyed taking to task in his book Improvisation. You might think the Frenchman’s uncompromising serialism and the free playing Bailey defended with such passion all his life would have little in common, yet both men were hugely influenced by Anton Webern. It’s an influence you can hear right through Bailey’s career in his obsessive exploration of tight parcels of registrally-fixed pitches, notably those trademark ringing harmonics. Meanwhile, Coe’s meandering semitones and sinuous arabesques here recall both Boulez’s clarinet writing in Domaines, and the harmonic world of Boulez’s own teacher Olivier Messiaen. 
Still, no traditional classical musical notation could ever render the extraordinary rhythmic subtlety and timbral complexity of this music. It’s at one and the same time dazzlingly virtuosic — Coe and Bailey are on stellar form throughout, and have enough sense to, yes, accompany each other where needs be — and supremely lyrical and spacious. 
An absolute delight.",Jazz
Dharma,Mr. Robinson,Souffle Continu,"“We try to reach within free jazz the same sort of rhythmic cohesion as in bop… based not exactly on tempo, but something which feels like tempo. A kind of underlying pulse.”
This is Dharma’s first LP: from the same neck of the woods as the Cohelmec Ensemble, a mixture of spiritual jazz, free jazz and electric Miles — especially for its keyboards — infused by the anti-authoritarian politics of collectivism and anti-hierarchism.
Saxophonists Jef Sicard and Gérard Coppéré are moonlighting from Claude Delcloo’s Full Moon Ensemble.",Jazz
Dharma,Snoopy's Time,Souffle Continu,"Their second LP, released three months after Mr. Robinson in 1970. 
Funky jazz-rock — tight, direct, restless. Pianist Patricio Villarroel lays on the Corea / Jarrett vibes; alongside bassist Michel Gladieux and drummer Jacques Mahieux.",Jazz
Dharma,End Starting,Souffle Continu,NA,Jazz
Dharma,Archipel,Souffle Continu,"‘Winding operations down after End Starting, Archipel is likewise planned-out music, mixing free rock and European free jazz in a series of collective explosions based on abrupt and contrasting improvisations. For much of the time, piano, guitar and saxophone intertwine over intense rhythms. Everything is electric, with the density of On The Corner, and flashes of viciousness all its own. 
‘Along with the Cohelmec Ensemble, the Workshop de Lyon, the Full Moon Ensemble, Perception, Armonicord or the Michel Portal Unit, the Dharma Quintet stands out as one of the most important examples of free jazz as it was played in France at the beginning of the 1970s.’",Jazz

The sleeve-notes quote a Downbeat article from the same year, claiming that Dickerson was the most important vibraphonist since Milt Jackson: ‘instead of solos made up of one related note following another, Dickerson often builds areas of sound, placing them one on the other, creating a total effect.’",Jazz

"Don Byron, Aruan Ortiz",Random Dances And (A)Tonalities,Intakt,"Brainy but intensely pleasurable piano-saxophone/clarinet duets; judiciously allusive, searching and rigorous.
Ortiz is a protégé of Muhal Richard Adams whose playing riddles Noncarrow with rumba, Messiaen with Monk, Yancey with yambu. Don Byron is a favourite of ours way back to Tuskegee Experiments and his revival of Mickey Katz. 
The opening tribute to Catalonian jazz pianist Tete Montoliu — who smuggled flamenco into post-bop — is twinned with something from Musica Callada, by Federico Mompou, a kind of Catalonian Satie. (“The complexity of simplicity,” Ortiz calls it. “Mompou’s music doesn’t land the way we expect it to, and the resolution is like a door to what’s happening next. Mompou’s pieces have a lot of these doors, and they give a lot of space to creativity.”) There are interpretations of Black And Tan Fantasy (by way of Thelonious Monk Plays Duke Ellington), Benny Golson’s Along Came Betty and Geri Allen’s Dolphy’s Dance; and a luminous arrangement of a Bach violin partita for solo clarinet. Byron chips in compositions dedicated to Lorraine Hansberry and Andy Capp; Ortiz some twelve-tone serialism and a tune based on ‘the triangular relationship within a series of three notes’.

For the solo Johnny Paycheck medley alone, this would be worth the price of admission, but the whole show is built on lightning-fast juxtaposition and hilarious interjection. Reissued here with an additional 26-minute track titled Richmond Dobro Massacre. One of the best free song outings ever made and an absolute must for every home.’",Jazz

From this inspired, inspiring starting point, the twosome frolicked through a rich program, McPhee donning tenor and alto saxes, and pocket trumpet, Drake turning momentarily to the frame drum. Each musician contributes an introspective solo track.

Herbie Hancock,Crossings,Warners,"‘Herbie took the basic instrumental tracks of Quasar and Water Torture to Patrick
Gleeson’s Different Fur Studios, hoping to learn how to play the Moog synthesizer. Instead, Hancock let Gleeson contribute layers of sound to both pieces: on Quasar extending the horn playing of Bennie Maupin, Julian Priester and Eddie Henderson through electronic accents; on Water Torture providing a ghostly counter melody on the Mellotron (using samples from string instruments). These studio enhancements give Crossings an
otherworldly dimension, making the album feel bigger and more fantastical, yet the Sextet’s playing — recorded without much in way of edits or overdubs — keeps everything grounded. Indeed, Gleason’s additions are often so natural that it is hard to pick out what’s acoustic and what’s synthesized.’

Herbie Hancock,Mwandishi,Warners,"‘After releasing their Warner Bros. debut, the Herbie Hancock Sextet underwent a major transformation in the early ’70s. Over the course of a year, every member was replaced (except Herbie Hancock himself and bassist Buster Williams) and each adopted Swahili names. Hancock chose the moniker Mwandishi (‘composer’), and the Sextet became unofficially known as the Mwandishi Band.
‘The lineup’s first album reflects Hancock’s new aesthetic and spiritual directions. Stretching out from the r&b/jazz-fusion of Fat Albert Rotunda, the pianist would draw inspiration from his time with Miles Davis…
‘Dedicated to Angela Davis, Ostinato is an extended jam with stunning rhythmic complexity — enhanced by such studio effects as Echoplex delay. On You’ll Know When You Get There, Hancock’s tight arrangements are saturated in reverb, which gives an ever-shifting dimensionality. Side-long closer Wandering Spirit Song, written by trombonist Julian Priester, goes even further out: alternating between dynamic soloing and group improvisation, the Sextet fully manifests the radical potential of their collective identity/energy.

Herbie Hancock,Head Hunters,Columbia,NA,Jazz
Herbie Hancock,Fat Albert Rotunda,Warners,"‘A playful, joyous album in which Hancock clearly had a great time, this music was composed for the pilot of a children’s TV show, redirecting the post-bop of his five-year stint with Miles towards new r&b and funk styles. Flying high with three horn players — Joe Henderson, Garrett Brown and Johnny Coles — alongside Hancock’s soaring Fender Rhodes, the group could swing freely on a track like the rousing Fat Mama and emote precisely on the subtle Tell Me A Bedtime Story.’",Jazz

Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra,Live At IUCC,Outernational Sounds,"Horace Tapscott is one of the unsung giants of jazz music. A gifted composer and arranger, a boldly original pianist, and above all a visionary bandleader, Tapscott’s recorded footprint is small, but his legacy continues to vibrate through the Los Angeles music underground. From Freestyle Fellowship to Build An Ark, Kamasi Washington and Dwight Trible, it all runs back to Tapscott. The pianist was an organiser, and instead of chasing a successful recording career, he wanted to build a community band that would act as “a cultural safe house for the music.” “I wanted to say, This is your music. This is black music, and I want to present a panorama of the whole thing right here.” “We would preserve the music on our ark, the mothership…”, aka the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra.
Tapscott had founded the group in 1961 as the Underground Musicians Association (UGMA). It changed its name to the Pan African Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and through the seventies the players lived, played and worked together. Community work and political consciousness were at the heart of the project, and for two decades they played in street, park and coffee house. With Tapscott as their guide and mentor, the Arkestra worked with theatre groups, poets and revolutionaries, ran music workshops and teaching sessions for children and adults, and played fundraisers, benefits and rallies for political and social causes both global and local. 
From 1973 to 1981 their main rehearsal and concert space was the Immanuel United Church of Christ (I.U.C.C.) on 85th St and Holmes Ave. The Arkestra played there every second Sunday, developing their sound and hipping new audiences to their vision. Live At IUCC, recorded in early 1979, was the only live recording the band released. In full flow, and at the height of their powers, the group recorded here features original 1961 UGMA members Linda Hill, David Bryant and Alan Hines, alongside the powerful voices of a new generation including Jesse Sharps, Sabir Mateen, and Adele Sebastian. 
Showcasing spiritualised classics from the Arkestra’s songbook, including heavy modal groovers Desert Fairy Princess and Macrame, Live At IUCC is a rare chance to hear one of the most important, foundational bands in all of jazz, stretching out in their own thing. With the great Horace Tapscott at the piano, this is the rarely captured sound of the mothership in full flight! 
Beautifully presented,180g audiophile vinyl.
Licensed from Tom Albach, who started Nimbus Records specifically in order to document Tapscott and his circle.",Jazz
Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra,The Call,Outernational Sounds,"Available on vinyl for the first time in forty years, Horace Tapscott’s burning, spiritualised 1978 set is a masterpiece of the Los Angeles jazz underground.
It’s drawn from two studio sessions in April 1978, one at Hollywood Sage and Sound, one at United Western. The latter session added a string section, which can be heard on the moody Cal Massey composition Nakatini Suite and Jesse Sharps’ swinging modal trip Peyote Song No. III, with its swirling soprano solo. In keeping with the communal nature of the Arkestra, the other two compositions, The Call and Quagmire Manor at Five A.M. are also by Arkestra members. But at the centre of the music is the builder of the Ark, the visionary whose original call to action started a movement whose legacy continues to this day — Horace Tapscott.

Heed The Call!",Jazz
Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra,Flight 17,Outernational Sounds,"First formed as the Underground Musicians Association in the early 1960s, Tapscott always wanted his group to be a community project. From its base in Watts, UGMA got down at the grassroots. They played for the people, organising fundraisers in parks and coffee houses, hosting teach-ins and workshops for young and old, and mixing it with radical theatre groups, firebrand poets, political radicals, Black separatists, community groups and churches. They lived communally, supporting each other and their people, and built an ark for the Black arts in the heart of the city. The group was renamed the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and soon after they established a monthly residency at the Immanuel United Church of Christ which ran for over a decade, while still playing all over Los Angeles and beyond. But through all this, they never released a note of music.
It was the intervention of Tom Albach, a fan of Tapscott and the group, that finally got them on wax. Determined that their work should be documented, Albach founded Nimbus Records specifically to release the music of Tapscott, the Arkestra, and the individuals that comprised it. The first recording sessions in early 1978 yielded enough material for two albums, and the first release was Flight 17. From the surging avant-gardism of Herbie Baker’s opener to the laid-back summertime groove of Kamonta Lawrence Polk’s Maui, or Roberto Miranda’s uptempo Latin jam Horacio, Flight 17 showcased the radical voices of the Arkestra’s members. 
Available on LP for the first time in forty years, in a lovingly re-created gatefold sleeve, adding two tracks never before on vinyl, this is the first flight on wax of the West Coast’s foundational community big band — energised, hip and together.

Hypnotic Brass Ensemble,Book Of Sound,Honest Jon's Records,"“We started with a cosmic idea that we were taught from a very young age – that the stars and planets make a sound, that deep in outer space there is audible harmony.” 
Book Of Sound is the brilliant, richly resonant exploration of these interstellar low ways. By turns urgent and contemplative, funky and reflective; varied in its textures, but entirely of one piece. Underpinned by cosmology, held in place by meditation, swirling with notions of history, science, theology, ancestry — this is a heady conceptual brew. But the music speaks loudest: ‘the sound of surprise’, magnificently retrieving Spiritual Jazz from the knacker’s yard.
It’s a deeply Chicagoan record. “It’s got the vibe of the lake,’ continues trombonist Cid, “the vibe of the prairies opening up to the west.” Also the Sun Ra albums recorded there in the 1950s, and — of course, being the dad of all seven ensemblists — Phil Cohran’s wonderful albums from the 1960s. 
“You know, it’s tough trying to satisfy everybody with our music. It’s hard enough satisfying ourselves, let alone the jazz scene, the hip hop guys, what have you. With this album we just dropped all that as a consideration, and tuned into deeper principles.” ",Jazz

Recorded in 1971, his first album under his own name (and a title pinched from Henri Michaux) is an extraordinary, odd, elaborate sonic collage, using just a handful of instruments including drums, organ and piano, and a tape recorder, but a wide open field of musical reference, including funk, machine music, prog and free jazz. It’s all ears to Barraqué (an acquaintance), Ravel and Debussy. Its solitary mappings of a fragile melancholy can be compared to Robert Wyatt’s The End Of An Ear; but really it’s an intensely personal affair,

Across the concert and the next afternoon’s audience-less recording session, the band was ignited by McPhee’s passion and his gorgeous post-Coltrane / post-Pharoah tenor. On Shakey Jake, they hit a James Brown groove filtered through Archie Shepp, while the sidelong title track is as searching and poignant today as it was during its heyday.

"Joe McPhee, Andre Jaume",Nuclear Family,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘A studio recording from 1979, previously unreleased. It is primarily structured around pairs of tunes by Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, and Duke Ellington (or Billy Strayhorn), adding Ornette Coleman’s Lonely Woman for good measure. The results are stunningly intimate and show the twosome’s capacity for creative interplay at a fairly early stage in its unfolding. Pithecanthropus Erectus gets pared down to its essential walking-bass-ness, while Monk’s Evidence is taken apart, and solo spots by both men are as riveting as one would expect.’",Jazz
"Joe McPhee, Mats Gustafsson",Brace For Impact,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘As searching and searing as anything either of them has made, these 2008 duets live up to their explosive title. Gustafsson is known for his energy, and it’s here in droves, but there are other nuances brought out by McPhee — a supple sense of melodicism (hey now, Gustafsson is a Swede, so by birthright he’s melodic) and the love of experimental sound-making that McPhee displayed on his sound-on-sound recordings in the late ‘60s…
‘Insanely powerful. We recommend that you prepare yourself for the impact.’",Jazz

John Tchicai With Strings,,Treader,"Spiritual jazz — frank, deep, reaching; no fakery.
Tchicai appears on Ascension and Ayler’s New York Eye And Ear Control; he’s on Witchdoctor’s Son, with Johnny Dyani and Dudu Pukwana, besides landmark recordings with Archie Shepp, including Four For Trane; and his Mohawk LP on Fontana is a five-star affair. Yet still Richard Williams in The Guardian reckoned this ‘wise and lyrical’ album ‘one of his best recordings’.
Here his playing is somewhere new, oscillating between Dolphy and Konitz. John Coxon and Ashley Wales are rivetingly attuned to him, on harpsichord, trumpet, electric guitar, sampling, bowls and percussion. In different ways the music evokes such talismanic recordings as Ayler’s set Swing Low Sweet Spiritual, Jimmy Giuffre’s live performance of Jesus Maria, Trane’s Dear Lord, and George Russell’s Electronic Sonata For Souls Loved By Nature.
Originally issued as a CD by Treader in 2005. This first vinyl release is hotly recommended.",Jazz

Johnny Hammond,Gears,BGP,"This Mizell Brothers production from 1975 is surely their masterwork. No hanging about on the grid — the sublime opener Tell Me What To Do flies like a Byrd; followed by the bonafide Loft classic Los Conquistadores Chocolates, a psychedelic, heads-down floor-filler which hit big at Ron Hardy’s Chicago Music Box as well as in NYC. Fantasy was a Paradise Garage staple; and Shifting Gears is here, too — a seriously funky breaks and block party anthem, heavily sampled by classic hip hop. It’s a must… not least in the form of this 40th anniversary LP edition, with six previously unissued tracks — five tasty new numbers and a skeletal version of ‘Can’t We Smile?’",Jazz

Johnny Hammond,Gambler's Life,Salvation,"His first, apostate recordings with the Mizell brothers. A kind of stepping stone between the Kudu set Higher Ground — tasteful but fusty, a few months earlier — and the classic Gears LP to follow next year. The new sound is all there in the title track, rollicking and street-wise, straining at the leash; Fender Rhodes, not Hammond B-3.

Traditionally its music is played in duet: a melody on one duduk; a low drone accompaniment, the dum, on another. Kolida Babo preserves and extends the dual nature of duduk music in many ways, replacing the dum at times with the tones of a Moog synthesizer to allow the two players to weave harmonies together in duet.’

Makaya McCraven,In The Moment,International Anthem Recording Co.,"Nineteen, hip-hoppin, be-boppin capsules of funk, conjured and distilled from a year’s worth of weekly shows by the drummer, in a reclaimed bank vault in the heart of Chicago’s Ukrainian Village. 
Jazz improvisation — but compact, to-the-point and organic as a mosquiter’s tweeter — dipped in krautrock, d&b, house and B-boy science. Featuring the brilliant vibes playing of Justefan, and local luminaries like Jeff Parker from Tortoise and De’Sean Jones from Underground Resistance.
Warmly recommended.",Jazz

Maki Asakawa,,Honest Jon's Records,"A stunning survey of the 1970s heyday of this great Japanese singer and countercultural icon.
Deep-indigo, dead-of-night enka, folk and blues, inhaling Billie Holiday and Nina Simone down to the bone. 
A traditional waltz abuts Nico-style incantation; defamiliarised versions of Oscar Brown Jr and Bessie Smith collide with big-band experiments alongside Shuji Terayama; a sitar-led psychedelic wig-out runs into a killer excursion in modal, spiritual jazz. 
Existentialism and noir, mystery and allure, hurt and hauteur.

Mark Murphy,Midnight Mood,MPS,"One of the great jazz vocal albums.
The NY hipster in Cologne for the day in 1967, with eight members of the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland big band, including Sahib Shihab and Ronnie Scott. Kicking off with Murphy unaccompanied in Duke’s Jump For Joy, the performances are masterful throughout, in wonderful repertoire, with a perfectly measured, enthralling introspectiveness.
Sconsolato in particular is ravishing, sublime Latin jazz, with casually brilliant drumming by Kenny Clarke and a gorgeous muted trumpet solo by Jimmy Deuchar, from Warrington. A desert island disc.

Masayuki Takayanagi New Direction Unit,April Is The Cruellest Month,Blank Forms,"‘Masayuki “Jojo” Takayanagi (1932 - 1991) was a maverick Japanese guitarist, a revolutionary spirit whose oeuvre embodied the radical political movements of late ‘60s Japan. Having cut his teeth as an accomplished Lennie Tristano disciple playing cool jazz in the late ‘50s, Takayanagi had his mind blown by the Chicago Transit Authority’s “free form guitar” in 1969 and promptly turned his back on the jazz scene by which he was beloved. Takayanagi had found a new direction, an annihilation of jazz and its associated idolatry of hegemonic American culture. Aiming his virtuoso chops towards the stratosphere, Takayanagi dedicated himself to the art of the freakout, laying waste to tradition left and right, most notably via the all-out assault of his aptly-named New Direction For The Arts (later, New Direction Unit) and collaborations with like-minded outsider saxophonist Kaoru Abe. His innovations on the instrument parallel those of Sonny Sharrock and Derek Bailey and paved the way for the Japanese necromancy of Keiji Haino and Otomo Yoshihide.’
This is the classic lineup, with Kenji Mori (alto sax, flute, bass clarinet), Nobuyoshi Ino (bass, cello) and Hiroshi Yamazaki (percussion), in 1975 recording sessions originally slated for release on ESP, before it went down later that year.",Jazz

Milford Graves,Babi,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘The long-awaited first reissue of one of the most legendary albums in the history of free music. Recorded live in concert in 1976, when Graves’ trio with saxophonists Arthur Doyle and Hugh Glover was at the height of its powers, Bäbi is a testament to the absolutely unique approach the drummer had established for himself. He had reconfigured the drum kit, removing the second heads on all the drums and replacing the snare with two toms, which allowed him a much more nuanced sense of indirectness in his multi-directional adventures in time. The track Ba remains one of the most astonishing feats of percussion alchemy ever waxed, as funky as ten slap bassists and as free as an exploding grenade. Doyle and Glover are incendiary, too, inspired by Graves to new and shocking heights of achievement, their hoarse cries and whistling split-tones carried to thrilling plateaus on the energy of Graves’ hands and feet.
‘In 2017, Graves discovered a previously unknown tape in his archives featuring the same trio at its inception, in home recordings made seven years earlier in 1969. Graves pummels a huge gong while Glover plays an instrument that, after sounding like none ever known, turns out to be bass clarinet. Extreme music recorded up close and very hot, it is among the most searing sessions never heard. Until now.’",Jazz

On Haitian Fight Song: ‘I can’t play it right unless I’m thinking about prejudice and persecution, and how unfair is it. There’s sadness and cries in it, but also determination.

Nate Morgan,Journey Into Nigritia,Outernational Sounds,"How many sixteen-year-olds would have the confidence to walk up to a revered bandleader, and inform him that one day they’d be playing together? This is how pianist Nate Morgan introduced himself to the founder of the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra. The teenager had heard Tapscott’s Flying Dutchman LP The Giant Is Awakened on the radio, and Arthur Blythe’s wailing sax had gone ‘straight to the heart. It was a spiritual experience.’ He was already studying with Joe Sample and Hampton Hawes; now Morgan showed up to all the Arkestra shows he could.
‘I could only take about two or three more concerts before I had to run up on stage. When I first introduced myself to Horace, he tells everybody that I said, “Yeah, I’m Nate Morgan. I’m going to play with you all.” Not that I want to, but that I’m going to.’
Over the next decade and beyond, Morgan would become a central figure in Tapscott’s UGMAA (Union Of God’s Musicians and Artists Ascension’), bringing new players like Jesse Sharps into the fold. During the early 1970s he also put in a stint with Rufus and Chaka Khan, and played on Willie Hutch’s Foxy Brown soundtrack. He remained active throughout the 1980s and 1990s, keeping the UGMAA flame alive in late night jams and private sessions, and working tirelessly around LA, including collaborations with Bone Thugs N’ Harmony. He was a participant in the early 2000s LA jazz collective Build An Ark. A true musician’s musician, Morgan died in 2013.
Originally released in 1983, this was the first of Morgan’s two LPs for Nimbus. Also featuring firebreathing reedsman Dadisi Komolafe, it’s a committed, spiritualised work that showcases Morgan’s heavy composing as well as his McCoy Tyner- influenced and technically flawless playing, with dedications to Coltrane (He Left Us A Song) and Cecil Taylor (Study In C.T.). 
Surging, modal jazz from the LA undergound, Journey Into Nigritia is a crucial recording by an unsung jazz legend.",Jazz

Ndikho Xaba And The Natives,,Matsuli,"Ndikho Xaba was born in 1934 in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, South Africa: for thirty-four years —  1964 –1998 — he lived in exile in the US, Canada and Tanzania. Originally issued by Trilyte Records out of Oakland, California, this 1970 recording is bracing, freewheeling Now Thing, suffused with SA idioms, and focussed by a political urgency wiring together US Black Power, Black Aesthetics and the anti-apartheid front-line like nothing else. You can hear Trane from the off — ‘a spiritual offering to my ancestors’  — and plenty of Sun Ra, with whom The Natives several times shared double-bills. Freedom is a gutbucket-soul rendition of the people’s anthem; that’s Plunky from the Oneness Of Juju playing saxophone on Nomusa; the thunderous finale features drummer Keita from the West Indies, and Baba Duru, who studied percussion in India, before winding up with Xaba blowing eerily through a horn made from a giant piece of tubular seaweed.",Jazz

"Okay Temiz, Johnny Dyani",Witchdoctor's Son,Matsuli,"The visionary Turkish percussionist and the great South African bassist were introduced by Don Cherry in 1969, when Dyani moved to Sweden after the break-up of The Blue Notes. They worked together regularly over the next decade, starting out with Cherry in the Eternal Ethnic Music trio. 
“Another world,” recalls Temiz. “At that time I was trying to learn as a big band jazz drummer, and when I met Don Cherry, I said, forget it. We played another kind of music. Indian music, Turkish music, Bulgarian, Chinese, you know… All kinds of music.” “Every musician,” Dyani said later, “should realize and acknowledge that folk music is the backbone of every music.”
Recorded in Istanbul in 1976; originally released in an edition of one thousand copies only, on the Turkish label Yonca. The first side features Turkish material arranged by Temiz; the second, SA-oriented music put together by Dyani, opening with a stunning interpretation of Cherry’s Marimba (Goddess Of Music).",Jazz

Sun Ra,"Monorails & Satellites: Works for Solo Piano Vols. 1, 2, 3",Cosmic Myth,"The two Saturns, from 1966; plus a third, previously-unreleased volume of five originals and four standards. 
‘More of a collection of statements than a style. Some of the tunes, with their odd juxtapositions of mood, could be mistaken for silent film scores. Perhaps they were audio notebooks, a way to generate ideas which could be developed with the band. Regardless, they serve as compelling standalone works. The fingering reflects Sun Ra’s encyclopedic knowledge of piano history as his passages veer from stride to swing, from barrelhouse to post-bop, from march to Cecil Taylor-esque free flights, with a bit of soothing candelabra- swank thrown in. Sunny’s attack is mercurial, his themes unpredictable. His hands can be primitive or playful, then abruptly turn sensitive and elegant. As with the whole of Sun Ra’s recorded legacy, you get everything but consistency and predictability. 
‘The listener also experiences something rare in the omniverse of Sun Ra recordings: intimacy. His albums, generally populated by the rotating Arkestral cast, are raucous affairs. With the Monorails sessions, we eavesdrop on private moments: the artist, alone with his piano.’",Jazz

Never reissued since its 1968 release by EMI India, Raga Jazz Style is a collectors’ holy grail of Indian jazz; and this is a highly impressive inaugural salvo by Outernational Sounds, using original masters and beautifully rendered facsimile artwork, with 180g vinyl pressed at Pallas, in Germany.

This five-song session has never been heard until now.’
It’s a buzzing, grooving, radiant blend of Latin, funk, soul and free jazz, by a septet featuring Khan Jamal, Byard Lancaster and Monette Sudler. An unidentified group of singers throws in a spiritual take on the Temptations, to close triumphantly.
With art by LeRoy Butler, who also worked for Ra at this time.

Spontaneous Music Ensemble,Oliv & Familie,Emanem,"The third SME LP, originally out on Marmalade, plus 31 minutes previously unissued. Oliv I is Kenny Wheeler and Derek Bailey soloing over a four-person voice and saxophone drone, eventually joined by a piano/bass/drums rhythm section. II is John Stevens, Maggie Nicols, Trevor Watts and Johnny Dyani — one of the great early examples of the free improvisation era, and the recording debut of Nicols. Familie is by an eleven piece group — including Norma Winstone — strongly influenced by Gagaku (Japanese court music).",Jazz

The first half of this CD is recordings intended to be the soundtrack of a film about drug addiction, in two parts, plus their re-working, made in September 1966; the second (adding Bailey) a new suite by Stevens, recorded six months later.
In the words of All Music Guide: ‘Sometimes, unearthed documents can leave you cold, even though the intellect appreciates the historical gap being filled. With Withdrawal, history doesn¹t matter. This is gold, pure artistic beauty. Actually the whole CD contains fantastic free music, almost completely detached from jazz, very atmospheric, delicate, and highly organic with a strong sense of discovery.

Band members might spend long hours practising a new composition, never to play it again. Here, we have a taste of the hidden: drawn from rehearsals at the Sun Ra house in Philadelphia from 1969, The Intergalactic Thing introduces a dozen never-before-heard pieces from Ra’s songbook, along with a handful of reworkings of such Ra classics as Spontaneous Simplicity and The Exotic Forest. Without a doubt, one of the most important augmentations of the Sun Ra catalogue in many a moon. In a beautiful gatefold jacket, including extensive liner notes by Ra discographer Robert L. Campbell, and a download coupon.’",Jazz

Clark Terry,Clark Terry And His Orchestra Featuring Paul Gonsalves,Sam Records,"Recorded for Decca France during Duke Ellington’s 1959 tour of Europe, in the final month of the trumpeter’s almost eight-year tenure with the band. 
‘Terry was one of the most gifted trumpeters to grace the Ellington band and he blossoms when he has more opportunities to solo in a small group setting like this one. Gonsalves proves to be the perfect foil for Terry as they trade lines on several of the numbers. Unlike many dates led by Ellington veterans, this one doesn’t rely heavily on songs from the vast Ellington songbook, including only Satin Doll. Also a Monk tune, a Babs Gonzales, and three of Terry’s compositions, best of all Serenade To A Bus Seat (revisiting his upbeat instrumental reflections on the hectic life of a touring musician).’",Jazz

The sophisticated, snappily-dressed black players of South Africa’s cities in the 1960s were not trying to ‘be like’ America; rather, they were enacting in their performance, and reaching through their horns for what a new South Africa might sound like.’

Likewise the music here: it comes at you from every angle, at different speeds, in infinite combinations. That‘s the beauty of Threadgill‘s music for Zooid: that sense of constant surprise.’",Jazz
Henry Threadgill,Dirt... And More Dirt,PI,"With fifteen musicians — guitar, bass, drums (2), cello, tuba, alto saxophone (3), flute (2), trumpet (2), trombone (2), and piano (2).
‘The works are part of Threadgill’s ongoing exploration for integrating composition with group improvisation, in particular an entirely new system of improvisation based on preconceived series of intervals. They bear the unmistakable stamp of all Threadgill compositions: complex forms, multi- layered counterpoint, rigorous polyphony, and timbral contrasts all wrapped up in a swirl of rhythmic convolution. The use of multiple horns and woodwinds on Dirt… vastly expands the music’s harmonic and tonal palette at Threadgill’s disposal, adding a much wider range of color, texture, and weight.’",Jazz
Henry Threadgill,"Double Up, Plays Double Up Plus",PI,"‘The New York Times called Threadgill a ‘composer and bandleader of intense, unyielding originality, nobody’s idea of a compromise.’ An early member of the AACM, he still believes in finding one’s individual path through original music. Here he builds on all of his prior work to create two magisterial works of great power and beauty. Together, they represent the crowning achievements in his still-flourishing half-century long career.
‘On board are holdovers Davila (tuba), Hoffman (cello), Filiu (alto saxophone, alto flute), Macdonald (alto saxophone) and Weinrib (drums, percussion) — but the interaction between three pianists lie at the heart of this piece, performing an intricate contrapuntal dance of varying attack, register, and density.’",Jazz

Bobby Timmons,The Soul Man!,Prestige,"Remarkable 1966 lineup of BT, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb, like a down-home, no film-flam criss-crossing of Miles and the Messengers. Downright unmissable for the secret-weapon version of Shorter’s all-time-classic Tom Thumb, and the first recording of Carter’s lovely, sinuous Little Waltz. Great record.",Jazz

Cal Tjader,Solar Heat,Modern Harmonic,"With a great band, including Ray Barretto, João Donato, Bobby Rodriguez and (doubling up on vibraphone) Gary McFarland. An easy-swinging 1968 blend of jazz, Latin and exotica, with tasty pointers to seventies funk like the breaks-rich title track. Other highlights include a moody Ode To Billy Joe, Donato’s Amazon, and — best of all — Fried Bananas.

Tom Prehn,Axiom,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘Arguably the rarest LP of European free jazz, recorded in 1963 for the Danish label Sonet, but not fully released. Impossibly uncommon, exceptionally wonderful music, featuring an extended tenor saxophone solo by Frits Krogh, influenced by Sonny Rollins, but strikingly his own man. The rhythm section is deep into non-metrical time, and comparisons to Cecil Taylor are valid, though Prehn’s playing favours chords and clusters over linear runs. For the CD, the two tracks of the original LP, mastered from both extant copies of the test master, are augmented by a single track from 1966, never before released.’",Jazz

Instead, what’s inside the pulse — resonance, fluid, potential — comes to the fore.’ ‘It’s not rare for recordings of improvised music to give a sense of the physical space between instrumentalists, but with Mr. Sorey’s trio, that air seems to be in a state of charged collapse, packed with magnetic density.’",Jazz

Guy Warren,Afro-Jazz,Return To Analog,"Guy Warren came through as a percussionist for ET Mensah’s Tempos, in 1940s Accra. Moving to London, he joined Kenny Graham’s Afro-Cubists in 1950; he deejayed for the BBC. In 1956 Warren released his first LP — Africa Speaks, America Answers — whilst relaying between the jazz milieux of New York and Chicago.
“He was so far ahead of what we were all doing that none of us understood what he was saying,” reckoned Max Roach. “He knew that in order for Afro-American music to be stronger, it must cross-fertilise with its African origins.”
Afro-Jazz is Warren’s most sought-after record. Startlingly, he fronts the Ian Carr/Don Rendell Group at the apex of their stay at Lansdowne Studios, in 1969. Warren, Carr, Rendell, Tomkins, Green, D’Silva, Garrick; produced by Denis Preston.

‘Described by Duke Ellington as being ‘beyond category’, Williams was conversant in jazz styles ranging from stride through swing and be-bop to the avant-garde, yet her music was always rooted in spirituals and the blues. This self-produced recording, originally recorded in 1962 and 1963, contains a mix of standards and originals including four original compositions reflecting her devout interest in religious music.’

A warmly accessible, beautifully performed, joyous mixture of wailing improv and propulsive, rootical preparations, this second album derives its upful, digressive theatricality from the Arts Ensemble Of Chicago, and its urgent sublimification of vernacular rhythms and melodies from Albert Ayler. Wild and free, but grounded in stuff like Bechet, Monk and George Russell. 
Terrific.",Jazz
Workshop De Lyon,Tiens!

This third Workshop LP was released in 1978 on the ARFI label. Pianist Patrick Vollat had left, so this is a quartet: Louis Sclavis, Maurice Merle, Jean Bolcato and Christian Rollet.
Sclavis fruitily to the fore, it’s the most rhythmic, low-down, silly-voiced and best fun of these three LP reissues — amongst the crown jewels of French free jazz — expertly produced as per by Souffle Continu.

Gripping, detailed, stately improvisation — a bit like the ùrlars in classical bagpipe music — which nervily mixes the sternly doom-laden with precarious, other-worldly wonderment. 
(The ondes Martenot is an amazing twentieth-century instrument — beloved by Messiaen, for example, and Varese. The theme-song of Star Trek is a vocal forgery of its sound. ‘J’aime cette fragilité qui côtoie la capacité de te décoller le tympan sur certaines fréquences inopinément,’ says Julie. ‘Je tiens une bombe dans les mains. J’aime son instabilité, son humanité.’)

Birds Of Venezuela,,Sub Rosa,"Beautiful recordings by the French ornithologist Jean Roche; introduced by David Toop.
‘The bird songs which i had recorded in the West Indies in 1969 made me inclined to find out more about those of the nearby South American continent, and convinced me, moreover, that musically speaking, they possessed an unquestionable originality in comparison with those of Africa and Europa. I therefore decided to carry out a series of orthinological trips on this continent, starting with the North… I disembarked at Caracas on 27th May 1972. The unusual musical volume of this tropical country made its impact on my arrival in town, where the unbearably shrill chirping of the cicadas overwhelmed me each time I passed under a tree. At night fall, around even the meanest of ditches filled by the daily rain, myriads of toads and frogs struck up a concert, which, through its sheer intensity, muffled all other surrounding noises. When I penetrated the forest, I could hear bird species literally by the dozen and individuals by the hundred, all calling and singing together at dawn and at dusk.’",Odds

‘For well-tuned just-intonation Fender Rhodes and sine wave drone, Mode Nouvelle Des Modalités is a probing meditation with shades of Paul Bley. Equal Temperament is performed on the same keyboard in twelve-tone equal-temperament tuning, with a tape delay system recalling Terry Riley, but more sombre and hallucinatory. Album centrepiece The Well-Tuned Marimba is an undulating marvel of lysergic drone, using well-tuned Yamaha, sheng, sine wave, and live electronics, evoking The Electric Harpsichord — a later Hennix masterwork — with marimba in place of harpsichord stops.’",Odds

‘David Edren’s organic, minimal electronics are never majestic or magniloquent (like Schulze or Froese); never neurotic or aggressive. It is a soft music, delineating echoes of sacred geometry in the emotional balance between oscillations, frequency modulations, and rhythmic pulsations. Diamonds, mineral combinations, emerald luminescences, hydrogen cascades and the stratospheric colouration of Jupiter and Saturn… 
Spoel is the description in miniature of the macrobiotic life of ‘unfolding planets’; more interior than exterior. A micro-tonal ensemble of blood streams, cells, strings of muscle and air passages, in the visionary tradition of Micheal Hoenig, J.D.Emmanuel and Tonto’s Expanding Head Band.’

Franco Battiato,Fetus,Superior Viaduct,"‘Sometimes Battiato gets likened to Brian Eno,’ writes Simon Reynolds. ‘A better analogy might be with Brazil’s Tom Zé or France’s Serge Gainsbourg… The mixture in Battiato’s music — especially evident in these early albums — of playful mischief and questing passion is captivating.’  
Originally released in 1971 on Bla Bla, Fetus explores themes of genetic engineering. Primordial, VCS3-synthesizer soundscapes shift between dream and delirium. FB’s unsentimental, yet evocative voice — twinned with infectious melodies and sublimely detached lyrics — is featured in haunting sound collages the length of pop songs, with ties to Pink Floyd’s Meddle, Os Mutantes and Jim O’Rourke.",Odds
Franco Battiato,Clic,Superior Viaduct,"‘Moving further out for his fourth LP, in 1974, via pure and elemental approaches to sound, flowing organically from one musical form to the next. Rippling with orbital chords, kosmische textures and schizophrenic string quartets, yet managing the same dramatic pacing and variety as his avant-rock albums Fetus and Pollution.
‘The LP’s dedication to Stockhausen comes into focus on the closing scramble through Italian shortwave radio, cut with bits of outernational folk music from around the world (whipped from a 1950s Henry Cowell compilation for Folkways). It’s the perfect ending to Battiato’s beautiful and expansive tour of the cosmos, announcing the uncompromising experimentalism that would dominate his work in this period.’",Odds

German Oak,Down In The Bunker,Now Again,"The definitive reissue of this milestone album of Krautrock, by turns fetishized and demonized for nearly four decades. Plus a second disc of both rare and previously unreleased music.
 In the booklet guitarist Wolfgang Czaika blames manager and organist Manfred Uhr for the band’s sustained nodding to Nazism, in the past; and titles like Swastika Rising are subbed here (along with the Hitler samples). Still, for The Quietus, these ‘nightmarish proto-industrial space jams’ remain ‘noxious and creepy enough’ on their own account; but still ‘unearthly and ahead of their time’. For example, ‘the nineteen-minute Missile Song, which cycles through clanging metallic percussion, ultra-sparse crypto-jazz drumming, a bass sound beamed in from a deep bath next door, outbreaks of haphazard haunted house onomatopoeia by unnamed instruments. It’s a bit Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun, early Faust, Sun Ra even, but sonically stunning for three rudderless rock trippers who basically just tossed this onto tape with no real thought about what might become of it.’",Odds

John Hammond was chuffed by the original release of The First Blues in 1983: ‘I recorded Allen in 1976 but Columbia Records refused to issue the results, considering the songs obscene and disrespectful.

Gokcen Kaynatan,,Finders Keepers,"Driving teenagers wild with his custom guitars, Kaynatan’s electrification of Turkish rock’n'roll at the turn of the 1950s was a keystone in the foundations of Anatolian rock. As in-house electronic composer of the country’s first national television channel, his influence flows through fifty years of Turkish pop culture (notwithstanding a discography of just four 7” singles to his name).

As a member of the Club St Germain house band he was quickly spotted by Eric Dolphy; everyone from René Thomas to Walt Dickerson took his number. During the 1960s he collaborated with Jef Gilson, François Tusques, Barney Wilen, Steve Lacy… He features on Sonny Sharrock’s Monkey-Pockie-Boo and Don Cherry’s Universal Rhythm.
Recorded in 1971, his first album under his own name (and a title pinched from Henri Michaux) is an extraordinary, odd, elaborate sonic collage, using just a handful of instruments including drums, organ and piano, and a tape recorder, but a wide open field of musical reference, including funk, machine music, prog and free jazz. It’s all ears to Barraqué (an acquaintance), Ravel and Debussy. Its solitary mappings of a fragile melancholy can be compared to Robert Wyatt’s The End Of An Ear; but really it’s an intensely personal affair,

Released in 1981, during the last years of the military dictatorship in Brazil, her own Estorias unfolds wonderful, shimmering, utopian counter-witness. Weaving together voice and prepared piano, violin, percussion, synthesizers and electric celesta; rooted in Brazilian music but notably influenced by Indian raga and Japanese Shomyo singing; inspired in part by the sounds of immigrant communities within her hometown of Sao Paulo: this is a masterwork of electro-acoustic music, as always beautifully presented by Blume.",Odds

Julius Eastman,The Nigger Series,Blume,"As Mary Jane Leach puts it, in her sleevenotes: ‘Julius Eastman wrote what can be categorized as minimal music, but also ‘post-minimal’ music before minimal music was fully established. His pieces straddle the two main styles of minimal music — rhythmic/pulse driven music (Steve Reich and Philip Glass) and spectral drone music (La Monte Young and Phill Niblock). While using process and rhythmic patterns, there is a flexibility that lends a breathing, organic feel to his music, a muscularity missing in a lot of other music from that time.’",Odds
Julius Eastman,"Evil Nigger, Gay Guerrilla",Blume,"‘Evil Nigger runs at a breakneck pace. The sheer density begins to drown out the percussive nature of the instrument. Eastman then manipulates these swarming clusters into extended tones that serve the piece’s melodic development. Finally, he strips the density away, leaving nothing but a few knotty notes punctuating several minutes of silence.’ 
With a burgeoning militancy, and a sexual suggestiveness to its layered sameness and symmetry, and a shift from white piano keys to black, ‘Gay Guerrilla starts with a serenely shimmering gallop that inevitably flows out in a deep, sprawling river, replete with a liberal quote from the Lutheran hymn, A Mighty Fortress Is Our Lord’, by way of Bach (Matt Wellins, in Dusted).",Odds
Julius Eastman,Crazy Nigger,Blume,"A big break for Julius Eastman was his lead part in the 1973 Nonesuch recording of Peter Maxwell Davies’ Eight Songs For A Mad King (funded by Ken Russell). A couple of years later, under the general guidance of Morton Feldman at SUNY Buffalo, his production of John Cage’s Songbooks was queerly risqué; and Cage was furious, pontificating at a lecture the following day that Eastman’s “ego… is closed in on homosexuality. And we know this because he has no other idea to express.” Promptly departing academia, Eastman reprised Eight Songs with Boulez at Lincoln Center. He was the favourite bass singer of Meredith Monk and Hans Werner Henze. He started a jazz combo with his brother Gerry, guitarist with the Count Basie Orchestra. Most famously he was a close collaborator of Arthur Russell, singing and playing keyboards for Dinosaur L. That’s him loud and clear on Go Bang.",Odds

Bonnet — the director of INA GRM — deconstructing the binarity ‘smooth’/‘striated’. ‘If ‘smooth’ is linked to ‘nomos’, within an open space of organic distribution, then ‘striated’ is associated with ‘logos’, as a kind of gridded enclosure. An interplay is mapped out, whereby pulsations become textures and layers, and where rhythmic elements are teased from the qualities and densities of sounds, rather than deployed as pre-determined sound objects in their own right, abstracted and frozen onto a temporal grid. ‘Striation’ is made audible only through the sonic landscape it inhabits, in the same way that animal camouflage comes alive in the woods and long grass, becoming redundant and inert out in the open.’",Odds

Kilchhofer Anklin,Moto Perpetuo,Marionette,"Electroacoustic exchanges between Benjamin Kilchhofer’s modular synth and the live drumming of Michael Anklin (from the Book Room sessions).
Inspired by the duo’s mountainous rural surroundings, where high plateaux abruptly give way to stony ravines and wooded trails, the recording embodies a fluid concept of time, with constantly shifting rhythmic pulses. The idea was to create an instrument in which musical contributions are interdependent (in the circular motion depicted on the cover), and the smallest disturbance might sway the entire system out of order. Its impossible prize is an ‘ur-klang’; a primordial, ancestral music.

Knud Viktor,Les Ephemeres,Institute for Danish Sound Archaeology,"The first time out for these amazing recordings, meticulously restored and presented by the Institut for Dansk Lydarkæologi. The 24-page booklet is richly illustrated by Viktor’s marvellous photography, besides extensive, absorbing notes.
‘After studying painting in Copenhagen, in 1961 Knud Viktor moved into some dilapidated 14th century limestone buildings on the slopes of the Luberon mountain in Provence in 1961. He describes being disrupted in his painting by the thousands of cicadae demanding his attention. “They settled on your body, on the walls of houses, everywhere. Cicadas everywhere.” Their sound mirrored the sunlight: when a cloud passed before the sun they would stop sounding or change their rhythm. Their sounds led him to experiment with field recordings. 
‘Often untreated and clearly recognizable, these recordings leave the inherent melody and rhythm of the animal sounds to sing for themselves, layering recordings to create simple and elegant sound images. In two of the twenty pieces Viktor’s own voice blends with the animals, as he recites two poems. One about the singing vineyard populated by musical crickets, the other painting an autumn picture with wine bubbling in the barrels as we hear the wine flies humming.’",Odds

Knockout stuff  — ‘the kind of music that can be heard when there is a storm outside,’ she called it — like No One Is There and Janitor Of Lunacy. The first run-out for Secret Song, her sing-a-long about Saint Ursula’s cohort of eleven thousand virgins, beheaded by the Huns.

Certainly he’d decided on his title even before coming across Parajanov. Already for Jaar a private emblem of change and upheaval, the fruit is broken open in the film: its juice seeps into a cloth, like blood, making the shape of ancient Armenia on a map. In hundreds of such moments of cultural and poetic saturation (including numerous different associations for the pomegranate), and in the film’s biographical, episodic form, Jaar found confluent ground for intimate, teeming musical reflections about his own life and Palestinian-Chilean heritage. “It gave me a structure to follow and themes to stick to. It gave clarity to this music that was made mostly out of and through chaos. It also gave me the balls to put it out.” ",Odds

The radiophonic voice of Ana de Carvalho poetically announces each scene: a vegetable market, interviews with villagers about their surroundings, braying animals, the hubbub of a train station. The intention is to enable ‘the possibility to ignore the sources to only listen to what the sound, in itself, is able to say, what is characteristic to its rapport with music.’ Various instrumentalists respond to these different sound-worlds.

Steve Reich,"Four Organs, Phase Patterns",Superior Viaduct,"‘If it is the radical edge of uncompromising hardcore minimalism that you are after, this reissue of Four Organs and Phase Patterns delivers two key examples.
‘‘I am interested in perceptible processes’ Reich had written in 1968. ‘I want to be able to hear the processes happening throughout the sounding music.’ Four Organs is a radical realisation of this goal. Against the steady rattle of maracas, individual tones within a single chord are gradually lengthened. No changes of pitch or timbre occur, and the drawn out nature of the process provoked outrage at some early performances, when audiences found themselves caught up in a decelerating loop, being dragged towards stasis. Phase Patterns, composed a month later, relies on a phasing technique developed during Reich’s earlier experiments with magnetic tape recordings, which he allowed to drift out of sync. Identical figures initially in unison shift out of phase, generating unexpected patterns.’
‘Obviously music should put all within listening range into a state of ecstasy’ (Steve Reich).

Sam Kidel,Silicon Ear,Latency,"Following on from his musical dissection of call centres — Disruptive Muzak was Boomkat’s Record Of The Year 2016 — Kidel trains his evil eye on the gatekeepers of online communication.
The first side clamps an ear of its own to the perimeter of Google’s server-room in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The sonic qualities of the space are invoked via architectural plans based on photos of the interior. Trespassing the endless tangle of cables and humming servers, bouncing off the maximum-security walls, the music is the genie of these acoustics of space.
Half-sister to William Burroughs’ strategy of targeting certain buildings — like the London offices of the Church of Scientology — by playing them back recordings of themselves, Kidel calls his own procedure “mimetic hacking”, taking dual inspiration from the Anonymous mirroring of sites, in order to meddle with the original content, and also the grand tradition of warehouse parties run without the permission of the property-owners. 
The flip enacts a subversion of the global scourge of data-gathering and surveillance. An audio patch disables voice recognition software by triggering phonemes. The music is engendered by these cascading scraps of words.",Odds

Thick, plucked bass-lines, close-miked drums, biting clavinet, subtle Gallicisms, eastern strings and percussion…’",Odds
Shackleton & Vengeance Tenfold,Sferic Ghost Transmits,Honest Jon's Records,"No-one else makes music like this: devilishly complex but warm and intuitive, stirring together a dizzying assembly of outernational and outerspace influences, whilst retaining the subby funk-and-hot-breath pressure of Shackleton’s soundboy, club roots. 
The result is an evolutionary, truly alchemical music — great shifting tides of dub, minimalist composition and choral song (Five Demiurgic Options); ritual spells to ward off the darkness (Before The Dam Broke, The Prophet Sequence); radiophonia and zoned-out guitar improv (Seven Virgins); even the febrile, freeform psychedelia of eighties noise rock (Sferic Ghost Transmits / Fear The Crown).
Over the five years since Music For The Quiet Hour, Vengeance’s vocal and lyrical range has rolled out across this new terrain. Throughout these six transmissions he’s hoarse preacher, sage scholar and ravaged bluesman; blind man marching off to war, and exhausted time-traveller warning of impending socio-ecological catastrophe. 
Six dialogic accounts of our conflicted times, then, expanding beyond the treacly unease of the duo’s early collaborative work into something subtler and more emotionally shattering — its shades of brightness more dazzling, and its darkness even murkier.
“We almost didn’t hear it when the foundations went.”",Odds
Shackleton With Ernesto Tomasini,Devotional Songs,Honest Jon's Records,"Shackleton’s most expansive, ecstatic and hallucinatory music to date. Four extended excursions channeling Congotronics way to the east, with an aura of restrained mania reminiscent of the feral pomp and gallows humour of Coil’s moon-musick phase.
The pairing with Tomasini is a match made in heaven. Swooping from deep growl to piercing falsetto, his four-octave voice both heightens the taste for the theatrical that’s always been integral to Shackleton’s music, and makes explicit the latter’s kinship to the occult energies of the UK’s post-industrial underground.
As the title suggests, these are shadowy songs rich with allusions to bodily ritual and psychic exploration, with Tomasini’s lyrics framed by luminous whirls of hand-struck drums and synthetic gamelan, bells and tumbling organ melodies, all earthed by dubwise bass. You Are The One escalates from delicate choral chant to full-bore psychedelic organ freakout; Rinse Out All Contaminants is a slow incantation, to purge all negative thoughts; the melodies of Father You Have Left Me are smudged like early Steve Reich, then burned out by snarling subs; and the magnificent Twelve Shared Addictions balances elliptical melodies like spinning plates, gradually unfurling into a breakneck storm of voice and hammered keys.",Odds

Over the next two hours the music throbbed and the projectors incrementally shifted inwards, their beams gradually uniting to form one pulsating, overlapping picture.’
For its 1972 premiere, Conrad played violin, and Rhys Chatham and Laurie Spiegel his hand-made instruments: the Long String Drone — a six-feet-long strip of wood with bass strings, electric pickup, tuning keys, tape, rubber band and metal hardware — and an arrhythmic bass pulse, throughout.",Odds

Killer after unnerving killer, though — from Neal Merritt’s drunkabilly I Like To Booze It, through Dan Price’s pervy nightmares and Forrest Green’s bottom-of-the-glass despair, to Little Carolyn Sue’s squeaky, sociopathic man-hating. 
Demented classics like Swamp Gas; anthems like Little Jimmy (going out to all dwarfs) and Poor White Trash.

Barney Wilen,Moshi,Souffle Continu,"Inspired, free, luminous music-making. An outernational holy grail and a stiff tonic for all citizens of nowhere. 
Already the great French jazz saxophonist had made monumental records alongside all-time legends like Monk, Blakey, Bud Powell and Miles — that’s Wilen on Lift To The Scaffold — before cutting loose at the end of the sixties on a two-year journey through Morocco, Algeria, Niger, Mali, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Senegal, with a team of film-makers, technicians and musicians. 
Moshi means trance utterance — the moshi is a demon invoked by the Fulani Borogi of Niger, to chase away angst and depression — and this is a shamanistic bricolage of smoky musical spells and scraps of intimate, outdoors ambience, full of love, good vibes and gritty musical wonder, drawn from more than fifty tape reels recorded en route: desert blues, space-jazz, street-funk, acid rock, polyphonic rhythms and new-thing influences like Shepp and Sanders; buzzing, extended ensemble sessions, like alternative Bitches Brews, crossed with diverse snippets of magic grabbed on the wing, like Algerian gnawa, or solo mbira, or just people laughing together, or a Bamako griot…

Bheki Mseleku,Celebration,Matsuli,"The story goes that Alice Coltrane gave her late husband’s saxophone mouthpiece to Bheki, recognising in the South African pianist ‘a kindred spirit to John Coltrane.’ 
His first release under his own name, Celebration was recorded and produced by World Circuit, who originally issued it on compact disc and cassette in 1992. 
Roiling with an historical sense of transition and upheaval, the sessions brought together musicians from SA, London and the US in the same months as the dismantling of apartheid, as if to put in lights the accession of South Africa to the to-and-fro of Black Atlantic culture. Counterposed to the album’s disclosure of the personal toll of exile, its evocations of inner peace and transendence are unmistakably marked by Trane and Pharoah Sanders, but elsewhere European classical forms and township marabi and mbhaqanga come to the fore.
‘The first thing that struck me about this album was the feeling of the music,’ says Shabaka Hutchings. ‘It had so much joy. It felt like it was so much more than the intricacies of how he was creating the music; it invoked the feeling of why this music was being made.’",Outernational

Then, after the cultural obliteration wrought by the Khmer Rouge, the music of the Cambodian diaspora in the 1980s and 1990s, beginning inside Thai refugee camps, from Khmer songs of the golden era to original music borrowing from both traditional and Western styles (romvong dance styles, maybe, or disco and new wave).",Outernational

In this period, klezmer music was venturing beyond its original role as Jewish wedding and celebratory music. It was proliferating in secular settings; sometimes disreputable, even underground. In the Odessa Stories, Isaac Babel mentions a bar with a house-band of ‘old Jews with dirty beards playing Romanian and Jewish tunes’; and klezmer would have been the soundtrack of the local brothels, pretty much all Jewish-owned. (One track here celebrates a new treatment for syphilis, Preparation 606… even lavishing a trumpet on proceedings.)

A rough, electric, rural take on the classic Congolese, Kenyan and Mozambican urban dancefloor styles of the 60s and 70s — hyper-fast interplay between pumping bass and clattering drums, overlaid with cranked-up high-life guitar — nourished with the musical traditions of local villages, especially in the lovely singing and other passages of acoustic respite.

Another walloping dose of Tsapiky music from Madagascar.",Outernational

Recorded in Athens at the studios of EMI Greece during the same sessions as Zaid Rahbani’s Abu Ali LP, and likewise edging into funk and disco, the second side is something else. In Al Bostah (The Bus), a woman recalls a bus journey with a lover, in scorching heat, to extended, hypnotic, uptempo, funkdafied disco.

Folk And Pop Sounds Of Sumatra,Vol. 2,Sublime Frequencies,"‘From the 1960s through the 1980s, from the infectious trance beat of Dangdut music, featuring rabab (violin) or saluang (flute), to the highly-refined and glorious Orkes Gambus (orchestral Arab music with ouds), said to have been brought to the island by Islamic settlers from Yemen, the seventeen tracks here will instantly convince the listener of the expressive beauty and diversity this wondrous island has to offer to the world music theatre. Most of the musicians on this release are Minangkabau or Minang people who are devout followers of Islam as well as the world’s largest matrilineal society. The other styles present are Sitogol (storytelling in vocal style), pop Minang music with talempong (small, rounded gongs played with mallets), Tari and traditional Minang music for ceremony and dance… and one brilliant track of Western pop. Keep in mind that this is NOT a document for the mere purpose of preservation, although it may serve as such. This is among the very best music you’ve never heard and you need to hear it NOW!’",Outernational

George became firmly ensconced in the London scene. His Club Iroko — in Haverstock Hill, north London — was a creative hub for groups like Osibisa, and a home-away to the likes of Fela, Funkadelic and Sun Ra.

Insanlar / Ricardo Villalobos,Kime Ne,Honest Jon's Records,"Stunning new music from Istanbul! 
A twenty-four-minute wig-out you can dance to — wild baglama improvisation and mystical male-unison singing, atop the propulsive mass of a Berlin half-stepper, with turbulent detours into dub, radiophonics and psychedelia.
‘Kime Ne’ means ‘so what’, ‘what’s it got to do with you’. The song adapts verses from the seventeenth-century poet Kul Nesimi, wistfully invoking the Melami strain of Sufism as a touchstone of humility and tolerance, in dark times. ‘Insanlar’ means ‘humankind’... ‘The Human Beings’.

Her Boiadeiro rocks more furiously than Ben’s, with a throbbing heaviness and complexity; her Taj Mahal becomes a fashionably lush Brazilian boogie; her Santa Clara morphs into a deep electronic groove, underpinning the  precision, range and ravishing melancholy of her singing. The downbeat Que Pena — from Ben’s eponymous 1969 LP — turns funky samba, with tasty electric piano…’",Outernational

Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force,Walo Walo Version,Ndagga,"Three killers heralding the next phase of this dazzling expression of a dream Dakar-Berlin nexus. All instrumental — though the opener has snatches of singing — with the vocal versions held back for the new album. 
The music just gets deadlier and deadlier — harder-boiled and deeper; more focussed, confident and dubwise.
Evoking the ancient cultural legacy of the griots, ‘Walo Walo’ is also the name of the sabar rhythm underlying the opener, which features Ibou Mbaye’s percussive synth-work, Mangone Ndiaye Dieng’s kit-drumming, and Bada Seck’s rigorous jolts of lower-pitched Thiol drum. The ‘Groove’ version is tough as nails; well and truly gnarly.
A tribute to the Baye Fall leader, Ndiguel Groove is a sparse, mellow interpretation of the most traditional cut on the album, showcasing Assane Ndoye Cisse’s insinuating guitar lines, Laye Lo’s super-elasticated snare-drumming, and Bada Seck playing the khine drums associated with the Baye Fall. (Short and wide; lightweight but low-pitched.)
Pretty awesome.",Outernational
Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force,Yermande,Ndagga,"Five years into the project, Yermande announces a thrilling new phase for this Dakar-Berlin collaboration: emphatically a giant step forward… and our outernational record of the year by a country mile.
The group of players is boiled down to twelve for recordings, eight for shows; sessions in Dakar become steeply more focussed. ‘This time around I was better able to specify what I wanted right from the initial recording sessions in Dakar,’ says Ernestus; ‘and further in the production process I took more freedom in reducing and editing audio tracks, changing MIDI data, replacing synth sounds and introducing electronic drum samples.’
Right away you hear music-making which has come startlingly into its own. Rather than submitting to the routine, discrete gradations of recording, producing and mixing, the music is tangibly permeated with deadly intent from the off. Lethally it plays a coiled, clipped, percussive venom and thumping bass against the soaring, open-throated spirituality of Mbene Seck’s singing. Plainly expert, drilled and rooted, the drumming is unpredictable, exclamatory, zinging with life. Likewise the production: intuitive and fresh but utterly attentive; limber but hefty; vividly sculpted against a backdrop of cavernous silence. 
Six chunks of stunning, next-level mbalax, then, funky as anything.",Outernational

Further, a few of these are deftly treated by Moritz, using Reichian de-synced double-tracking, and discreet effects. Also two ten-minute dubs: a deadly, signature Berlin steppers, plus its version; and an echoing, mystical drum session, recorded live on stage in Bishkek.

In the modern era, the gramophone brought all kinds of music to the mix; and violins and accordions were replaced by electric guitars, drums and keyboards, as psychedelic synths, fuzz and elastic bass lines re-cast the traditional polyrhythms of drums, ravannes, bongos, claves, triangles and maracas.

From 1975, Black Power sounds like nothing else in the canon: a lost message drifiting in from the flower power era, imbued with a fiery Zambian voice.’ 
‘Zamrock came to embody the economic despair that followed the 1973-1974 oil crisis, which flung Zambia into recession and exacerbated a wide range of social tensions. Much of Zamrock also captured the controversy of wider politics in Africa and the world. Perhaps the finest example of this is Black Power by The Peace’ (The Guardian).",Outernational

The sophisticated, snappily-dressed black players of South Africa’s cities in the 1960s were not trying to ‘be like’ America; rather, they were enacting in their performance, and reaching through their horns for what a new South Africa might sound like.’

The legendary, moody Beirut singer Būlus Ṣulbān is here — some historians have him singing before Egypt’s Pasha Ibrāhīm Bāshā during his military campaign in Syria, in 1841 — and Ḥasība Moshēh, Jewish ‘nightingale of the Damascene gardens’. Thurayyā Qaddūra from Jerusalem; Yūsuf Tāj, a folk singer from Mount-Lebanon; Farjallāh Baiḍā, cousin to the founders of Baidaphon Records… Musical directors like the lutist Qāsim Abū Jamīl al-Durzī and the violinist Anṭūn al-Shawwā (followed by his son Sāmī); such virtuosi as the qanun-players Nakhleh Ilyās al-Maṭarjī and Ya‘qūb Ghazāla, and lutist Salīm ‘Awaḍ.
Even at the time, notwithstanding such brilliance, public music-making was frowned upon as morally demeaning, especially for women. Musical venues were generally dodgy. Ṣulbān once cut short a wedding performance for the Beiruti posh, after just one song, he was so disgusted with his audience. 
‘If I had to tell you about the catcalls,’ one commentator wrote about the musical theatre of the time, ‘the stomping of feet, the sound of sticks hitting the ground, the noise of the water-pipes, the teeth cracking watermelon seeds and pistachio nuts, the screams of the waiters, and the clinking of arak glasses on the tables, I would need to go on and on and on…’",Outernational

Vetson' Androy,Mavandeza,Sofrito,"Deep, storming Salegy sounds from Madagascar.
Salegy is the electrified updating of the traditional Antsa style from the north-west of the island — 6/8 rhythms, layered with percussion and call-and-response vocals — and the Vetson’ Androy group one of its most popular proponents. 
From 1978, Mavandeza has the heady urgency of killer Fela — with two women singers out front, psychedelic organ and prowling-lion bass.
The flip is from a decade later, by Malagasy superstar Eusebe Jaojaby — rough and tough dancefloor worries, with a mazy string-line, mash-it-down percussion and lilting flute.

Guy Warren,Afro-Jazz,Return To Analog,"Guy Warren came through as a percussionist for ET Mensah’s Tempos, in 1940s Accra. Moving to London, he joined Kenny Graham’s Afro-Cubists in 1950; he deejayed for the BBC. In 1956 Warren released his first LP — Africa Speaks, America Answers — whilst relaying between the jazz milieux of New York and Chicago.
“He was so far ahead of what we were all doing that none of us understood what he was saying,” reckoned Max Roach. “He knew that in order for Afro-American music to be stronger, it must cross-fertilise with its African origins.”
Afro-Jazz is Warren’s most sought-after record. Startlingly, he fronts the Ian Carr/Don Rendell Group at the apex of their stay at Lansdowne Studios, in 1969. Warren, Carr, Rendell, Tomkins, Green, D’Silva, Garrick; produced by Denis Preston.

Raging Tubbys fire.",Reggae
Bobby Sarkie,Over And Over,Wackies,"Rudie will recognise Bobby Sarkie from The Tartans and The Immortals (not to mention his solo roots killer Better World). His singing here is expertly reined in by desolation, numbness and regret, over a hollowed-out, mesmeric rhythm, with some nasty synth-work and casually brilliant effects on the drums. The vocal cut is more than a minute longer than the version which opens the Jah Son Invasion album with such a flourish; and the mix is different, with more prominent keys, and toned-down bass. It’s previously unreleased, like the dub.
The B-side is booby-trapped with sensational instrumental excursions on Junior Delahaye’s Working Hard For The Rent Man and Jackie Mittoo’s almighty Drum Song, which conclude the same original tape-reel as Over And Over. Rent Rebate features masterful, boppish soprano saxophone-playing by Roland Alphonso, and restrained guitar interjections by Barry Vincent, with a Spanish tang. The superb hand-drumming on Mount Zion is by Ras Menelik; and it’s Mittoo himself on organ (or just maybe Clive Hunt, Wackies can’t quite remember).",Reggae

Annette Brissett,Love Power,Wackies,"Originally out in 1983, Love Power is co-produced by Fabian Cooke (from Itopia) and Lloyd Bullwackie Barnes, with assistance from Prince Douglas. Cooke plays most of the instruments himself, with his drumming centre-stage, though Ras Menelik puts in a brilliant shift on congas, and backing vocals are by Sugar Minott and the Love Joys. Cooke’s own well-crafted compositions are joined by covers of Irene Cara and the Four Tops, infectiously bridging roots, lovers and synthy, soulful eighties boogie. 
Betrayed is solid-gold, signature Wackies. He’s My God is a tasty sip of low-slung, grooving gospel-reggae. Evoking Michael Jackson, the jamming album-closer Drums is top-notch disco-reggae, opportunely poised for revival.
Terrific stuff, full of personality, charm and in-ting hybridity. ",Reggae
Annette Brissett,Betrayed,Wackies,"Deep, rootical lovers, darkly seething with one-step-at-a-time hurt and steely, vengeful self-esteem. Hypnotic, stripped and desolate, with implacable drums and bass, dubwise from the start, the production is classic, unmistakable Wackies, featuring Fabian Cooke’s scattered, abrupt organ stabs and minimal guitar-work, Ras Menelik’s masterful nyabinghi drumming, and harmonic commiseration by Sugar Minott and the Love Joys (with a strangled sob at intervals). 
Over six minutes, the extended mix is different to the Love Power LP; and the additional dub, released here for the first time, is unmissable for its extra rawness and dubbed-out emptiness.
Plus thirteen minutes of blissful disco-reggae on the flip: two contrasting dubs of the Giorgio Moroder/Irene Cara/Flashdance cut from Love Power, both previously unreleased and a bit sick.",Reggae

I like the blend of instruments. If you listen to my mix it’s a blend, nothing really sticking out sometime. A lot of other dubs, something sticks out, or becomes contrary or overloaded. I didn’t mix like that. I liked it to be musical. It wasn’t very hard, because most of them were very good songs, they were unique songs, so you couldn’t generally go wrong.”

Then I went down to Mrs Pottinger, did one song for her named Live and Love on the Gay Feet label. It was played on the radio for a couple of days and it wasn’t going anywhere really because she had some good artists down there at the time and they did some songs that were doing well, so my song wasn’t getting much promotion and it wasn’t being played. I think I heard it twice on the radio and then I didn’t hear it anymore.”",Reggae

Elsewhere Jah Batta takes deejay duties — likewise Prince Douglas himself. (And there are lovely skewed graphics by team regular Leslie Moore, self-styled ‘LAM International’). But the deadliest cut of all reworks another gift, Steel Pulse’s Handsworth Revolution, which arrived in a parcel of records from England the same weekend as the session: March Down Babylon Dub, with Bullwackie himself at the microphone in his Chosen Brothers guise, as steely and apocalyptic as Douglas Levy’s fabulous production.",Reggae

Noel Ellis,To Hail Selassie,Summer Records,"First son to Alton Ellis, Noel is the second voice on Willie Wiliams’ Rocking Universally, as DJ Papa Cousin; and here his singing compellingly emulates the Messenger Man’s enraptured, slightly slurred, incantatory delivery, at the same time casting off his dad’s old-school demonstrativeness. Still, the song takes its inspiration from Alton’s sublime Hurting Me, on his Sunday Coming LP for Studio One, and Jackie Mittoo is fittingly amongst the musicians on call for the re-working; also Johnny Osbourne and Bongo Gene on percussion.
‘I were trying to achieve my own sound,’ the producer Jerry Brown has recalled. ‘We didn’t copy Channel One; we just tried to do our own thing, y’know? Them sounds are dangerous, man… Dangerous!’
Sure enough, To Hail Selassie is almighty murder. Stone classic reggae. Rocking and ruff, wasted and odd, hypnotic and super-atmospheric, it finds its own imperious way in the same Black Ark fall-out as the best of Bullwackies and Half Moon.
Both sides complete with dubs, in different mixes to the Light In The Attic LP. Reissued by Iroko.
Very strongly recommended.",Reggae
Noel Ellis,Memories,Summer Records,"A heartbreakingly soulful lament about the losses entailed by his emigration to Canada in the early 1970s, as a young Jamaican teenager; with the same reverberative musical spaciousness and detailing as the most sublime Upsetters. (The homonymous Junior Murvin song comes to mind.)  Written by Tony Hibberts — nephew of Winston Francis — who also plays bass.
Plus Dance With Me on the flip, a bit more party hearty; as sampled by poor Kanye West.

Keith Hudson,Playing It Cool And Playing It Right,Basic Replay,"It was intended that one of Hudson’s teenage sons would voice the dubs. In the event the Love Joys, Wayne Jarrett, and most inimitably Hudson himself featured at the microphone. Like Wackies, Hudson was a Studio One devotee — ‘I used to hold Don Drummond’s trombone for him so I can be in the studio’ — and the album follows Coxsone’s recent strategy of overdubbing signature rhythms. 
The Studio One sides were aimed at the dancefloor; Hudson’s reworks of tracks like Melody Maker are more psychological. Heavy Barrett Brothers rhythms are pitched down and remixed deeper still with reverb, filters and other distortion, and overlaid with new recordings of guitar, percussion, keyboard, voice, often crazily treated. 
Originally released in 1981 on the Joint International label, in NYC.

Gregory Isaacs,Warning,Dub Store,"A master-class in digikal dread, by the Cool Ruler and King Tubby.
Swingeing Firehouse rhythms, expertly dubwise, with driving, tumping bass, and the burning horns of Dean Fraser and Vin Gordon. Utterly masterful singing.
The overall mood is foreboding, sombre and distressed. ‘Your trouble wanna trouble you,’ warns Gregory. ‘War in the morning, war in the evening.’ ‘Everyone is wondering who will be next.’ 
The gist is the toll of everyday living — paranoia and alienation, loneliness and heartbreak, drugs and violence — and the gravitational pull of prison, so it’s great to see the emblematic art-work of the original UK issue, by the aptly-named Serious Business, back again. (We miss the Rudy Gone Whaling typo of an old bootleg, still.) 
Typically dapper, trash-and-ready reissue by Dub Store in Tokyo, with ace sound, handsomely sleeved (though the tracks are listed in the wrong order).
Masterworks like Long Sentence, Once A Man — giant-slaying Fade Away excursion — and Badness.
Hotly recommended.",Reggae

Gregory is desolate and compelling… and the dub is murder.",Reggae
Gregory Isaacs,Temporary Lover,Dug Out,"Masterful Gregory from 1997, sounding spooked and hunted over a juddering, propulsive Music Works rhythm, fulgent and full-on, with deep, pounding bass, clattering percussion, parping horns, classy backing vocals and harp starbursts… top-notch Gussies.
Two extended vocal versions, and two dubs, all quite different.

Wayne Jarrett,Showcase Vol. 1,Wackies,"Recorded at Bullwackies just weeks apart from Horace Andy’s Dance Hall Style: two of the very greatest vocal reggae LPs of all time. 
Between stints in JA for legends like Glen Brown and Junjo Lawes, WJ commuted to the Bronx from Connecticut. With Clive Hunt in full effect, Showcase follows the six-track dubwise format of Dance Hall Style (Wayne never sounding more like Horace), including four utterly lethal Studio One versions — Azul’s killer Rockfort Rock, Sleepy’s Every Tongue (with outrageous Isleys fuzz), yet another Wackies’ Heptones via Leroy Sibbles, and a murderous Drum Song.

Mabrak,Drum Talk,Dug Out,"Leroy Mattis’ first drum was a plastic butter container. ‘My mother wouldn’t buy me a drum because back then the situation in Jamaica was very tense… In 1960 Jamaica was still an English colony, and the drum is a roots instrument.’ Tommy McCook was living two doors down; during the first years of The Skatalites, Mattis would practise there. In 1970 he was National Junior Drumming Champion, with Count Ossie winning overall; four years later his ensemble battled in the Senior finals with the drummers of the Light Of Saba.
‘Our group was initially called Genesis, it was a 7-piece drum group, but I changed the name to Mabrak, which means Thunder in Amharic. We knew that we were coming with a heavy sound.’
Experiments in percussion, in the middle of the night at Harry J’s. Funky versions of rhythms like Curly Locks and Too Late To Turn Back Now, led by talking drums. Blaxploitation is in the air… the Staples… even a blast of Barry White. Beautifully mixed by King Tubby, who couldn’t believe his ears. 
Originally released in 1976, in paper inners only. Smartly sleeved in quintessential Dug Out style this time around — with an insert, including a recent interview with Mabrak.",Reggae

Tommy McCook,Alimawi,Earth Sound,"Gorgeous, tight, rocking, rastafarian jazz from 1970, originally produced by Treasure Isle engineer Byron Smith for his own Baron’s imprint. Sounds from the East, sparklingly performed, with crisp percussion, rugged horns, mystical chanting, out-of-tune piano and twanging guitar. The Supersonics trumpeter leads the way — not TM at all, but presumably Baba Brooks boppishly copping a little Simon And Garfunkel for his melody.

Ras Michael And The Sons Of Negus,Promised Land Sounds,Dug Out,"‘Rockin live ruff and tuff’, this is the untrammelled counterpart to Dadawah, six years later in 1980, fresh from the Upsetter: free, rawly spiritual trance-music; a full-force nyabinghi freak-out.
The drummers are headlong and rollicking, thunderous and explosive. Even more so than Dadawah, the mix is ecstatically echoey; giddily dubwise without let-up. Ras Michael himself sings from the mountain-top, like he just don’t care — at the top of his lungs, in voices, screeching like a bird — with the delirious abandonment otherwise owned in reggae by Lee Perry. Amongst the uncredited performances swirled into proceedings, there are squiggles of flute straight from the Upsetters song-book, the minor-key organ stabs and abstraction of electric space-jazz, and sax-playing more attuned to the Headhunters than the Blazing Horns. (I Ya I in particular is a stunning fifteen minutes.)
This is the real thing, music without affectation. Pure reggae. Sun Ra fans should love it; anyone with ears to hear. 
Prepared and manufactured at Abbey Road, D&M and Pallas; beautifully presented in rigid, old-school, tip-on sleeves, with matt-coated fronts and untreated-paper backs; 180g vinyl.
‘These sounds are sounds of inspiration and love and culture to the universal benefit of mankind… So therefore meditate and stop hate.’
Very hotly recommended.",Reggae
Ras Michael And The Sons Of Negus,Numbered Days,Dug Out,"Magnificent nyabinghi roots warning.
The one-and-only Eric Frater is drafted in from Studio One, playing killer rhythm guitar (with Chinna on lead); and likewise Dennis Ferron — Jah D — who leads the way with his spiritualized keyboard-work, keening between jazz and soul. You can hear Puma from Black Uhuru, singing with the Sons. Geoffrey Chung at Dynamic expertly pulls in the bass drum and doubled-up fundas and repetas, keeping the mix raw and alive.  
The dub in particular is stunning — thumping, trenchant and brooding, so steeply dread and haunted it almost trips over its sense of yawning silence and doom.",Reggae

Producer Gussie Clarke says Theophilus ‘Easy Snappin’ Beckford is playing piano, with the front removed so he can strum the strings (like he finally snapped) — but he credits the work overall to Augustus Pablo. 
Transferred from acetate — fuss-pots don’t grumble, just be humble — though the flip brings a clutch of criss, unmissable alternates, direct from Gussie’s tape-room (where the files are entitled ‘Classical Illusion / The Sun’).

Nobody not gonna allow you to mix.’ I would keep on bugging him, bugging him, bugging him. But he always just had me doing TV repairs, fixing the amplifiers and stuff for him. One day when Jammy failed to come — like he always do most of the time — Tubby’s made me a bet. He said, I bet if I send you around there to work, you wouldn’t know the first thing to do.

The Chosen Brothers,March Down Babylon,Wackies,"Stone classic Bullwackies (as excursioned by Rhythm & Sound for Burial Mix), sensationally featuring two unreleased dubs, newly extracted from the master reels. Both are equally unmissable but quite different, with contrasting effects: the second dub adds ninety seconds, including whip-dem spring reverb. Drawn from the Selective Showcase LP, the vocal mix is more open and dubwise than the Sing & Shout LP offering, with less keyboards. 
Asked whether it should be mash or march, after some pondering Bullwackies replied: “That’s a good question.”",Reggae
The Chosen Brothers,Sing & Shout,Wackies,"A fresh iteration of the mid-eighties LP (itself a compilation of recordings from the previous five years or so), replacing two tracks — Dancing In The Rain and All Things — with their full 12” versions. 
This is a deeply personable, expert, limber blend of roots and lovers, kicking off with an exclusive mix of the deadly Mash Down Babylon; dropping classic, lush, spaced-out Wackies dub science to close; and taking in reworkings of Lickshot, Billie Jean and The Righteous Flames’ I Was Born To Be Loved, along the route.
The moniker ‘Chosen Brothers’ is Lloyd Barnes’ spiritual way of sharing the credit for his solo projects. “Anyone in the studio at the time could be a Chosen Brother,” he says. In this case a full crew includes Sugar Minott and Prince Douglas at the desk; Jah Batta, Milton Henry, Wayne Jarrett and Junior Delahaye all on backing vocals; and such dream-team Bullwackies instrumentalists as Clive Hunt, Jerry Johnson, Fabian Cooke and Ras Menelik.",Reggae

The Shades,She's Gonna Marry Me,Techniques / Dub Store,"The Shades had freshly peeled away from The Techniques, because besides singing Winston Riley wanted to try producing, and Bruce Ruffin needed room… and this is a gem of a calling card.
Sweetly hopeful, rocking rocksteady — with an undertow of foreboding — which Junior Delgado revisited for Dennis Brown, ten years later.

Yabby You Meets King Tubby,Walls Of Jerusalem,Pressure Sounds,"One half of this is the LP issued back in the day as Chant Down Babylon Kingdom, on the Nationwide label, split between Yabby You vocals and Tubbys dubs.
On the second platter Pressure Sounds unleashes a deadly tranche of previously unreleased mixes and outtakes, which shed ‘a revealing light on Yabby and Tubby’s working methods, and put the listener right next to the musicians in the studio. They frequently tried out different approaches on alternate takes, bouncing the 4 track tapes from one machine to another to free up tracks for overdubbing. Alongside chatter from the studio musicians, you can hear Yabby (in the vocal booth) communicating with Tubby (over his ‘talkback’ mic) as they shape the finished tracks. Yabby is constantly conferring with “‘bra (brother) Tubbs”, whilst Tubby keeps track of multiple takes of the same song. In the runup to ‘Love Of Jah’ you can really hear the two interacting, as Yabby asks “How that sound?” Tubby, typically understated, replies “Not bad.” Other highlights include “The Man Who Does The Work”, with Yabby singing a beautiful solo vocal with far less harmony accompaniment than on the released version, and an alternate cut of ‘Go To School Jah Jah Children’ with a flute and horn accompaniment (also used on the album’s dub version) and markedly different lyrics.’",Reggae

Bayou Maharajah,The Life And Music Of New Orleans Piano Legend James Booker,Cadiz Music,"Unmissable film! 
A rawly soulful, moving tribute to the out-of-this-world artistry of James Carroll Booker, with dazzling clips of him in performance, various compelling interviews with his inner circle — where celebration and awe are cut with bitter frustration — and beautifully judged footage of the New Orleans locale.
In his autobiography, Queen Of The Junkers Joo Joo, Booker wrote: ‘It never occurred to me, until the age of four or five, that I was not a female, plus equipped to talk. The first woman I wanted to marry without doing it against my will was actually Tallulah Bankhead and another chick was a dude who identified herself as the Toast, the muffin or the Footloose Fancy Fruitcake among other commodities. Since then I heard she has not yet entered the Unorthodox Book of the almost Living.’ 
Booker liked dressing up as a woman called Juanita; he got nicked for impersonating plod. He did a stretch in Angola State Penitentiary, for drugs. He told people that Ringo Starr put his eye out, in a fight. He was way larger than life; just like his stunning piano-playing never shuts down into either ragtime or jazz, blues or classical (especially Chopin), and his singing is free as a bird.
Booker was born in 1939, around the time Jelly Roll Morton died (as he liked to note). Aged fourteen, his first recording under his own name was Doing The Hambone, for Dave Bartholomew. That’s really him playing piano on a bunch of Fats Domino and Little Richard records. He accompanied everyone from Bobby Bland, to Ray Charles, to Aretha. Amongst scores of 45s, his 1960 organ instrumental Gonzo — named after a mythical smack addict — was Hunter Thompson’s theme-song, and a smash for Peacock. Dr. John called Booker ‘the best black, gay, one-eyed junkie piano genius New Orleans has ever produced’ (which is faint praise).     
Big Easy portions of staggering, utter musical genius, sexual transgressiveness, drugs and booze, suffering, waste and mania. 
James Booker… such a don.

We didn’t accept that separation. Sipho, although he was born in KZN, could play any feel. Sometime he’d joke, Does my bass line feel coloured enough?’

Christians Catch Hell,"Gospel Roots, 1976-79",Honest Jon's Records,"Utterly magnificent, sublimely soulful survey of the Gospel Roots label, subsidiary of the mighty TK Records at the height of the Miami Sound.
A&R was co-ordinated by Gospel legends Ira Tucker — from the Dixie Hummingbirds — and Ralph Bass, veteran producer with Savoy, King and Chess. The label was run by Timmy Thomas, who had recently smashed with Why Can’t We Live Together, for another TK spin-off, Glades. Operations were overseen by Henry Stone himself, unlikely King of Disco, who had recorded a young Ray Charles, and pushed forward James Brown. They drew in artists from all over the US, from St. Louis, Columbus, Memphis, Brooklyn, Cabrini Green in Chicago: unknowns like Camille Doughty, reluctant to jeopardise her job at GM (‘Generous Motors’) in Detroit, and huge-sellers like the revered Brooklyn All Stars, who started out on Peacock in 1958. 
Choral belters, deep ballads, harmony quartets, epic city-blues, gritty funk, powerhouse female soul… Killer-diller Philly like a scorching version of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes’ Wake Up Everybody; and Jean Austin’s raw Spirit Free, co-written by Ronnie Dyson, produced by Jesse James at Future Gold. Chicago Sound like The Fantastic Family Aires — named after the family’s furniture store on North Cicero, but reminiscent of the Staple Singers at their best — through to the full-blown glory of The Fountain Of Life Joy Choir, led by Marvin Yancy from The Independents, and featuring Natalie Cole… Singers like Versie Mae Gibson, from the Jordans, by rights up there with Irma, Etta and Ree… Bangers 100%-guaranteed to find their way into Theo Parrish sets; and mortal delirium for the prissiest of soul and gospel purists.
Beautifully presented… the LPs with a 12”-square, full-colour, sixteen-page album of photos and original artwork, the CD with a forty-page booklet — and truly outstanding notes, including insightful new interviews across the board; mastered at Abbey Road.

John Hammond was chuffed by the original release of The First Blues in 1983: ‘I recorded Allen in 1976 but Columbia Records refused to issue the results, considering the songs obscene and disrespectful.

Hypnotic Brass Ensemble,Book Of Sound,Honest Jon's Records,"“We started with a cosmic idea that we were taught from a very young age – that the stars and planets make a sound, that deep in outer space there is audible harmony.” 
Book Of Sound is the brilliant, richly resonant exploration of these interstellar low ways. By turns urgent and contemplative, funky and reflective; varied in its textures, but entirely of one piece. Underpinned by cosmology, held in place by meditation, swirling with notions of history, science, theology, ancestry — this is a heady conceptual brew. But the music speaks loudest: ‘the sound of surprise’, magnificently retrieving Spiritual Jazz from the knacker’s yard.
It’s a deeply Chicagoan record. “It’s got the vibe of the lake,’ continues trombonist Cid, “the vibe of the prairies opening up to the west.” Also the Sun Ra albums recorded there in the 1950s, and — of course, being the dad of all seven ensemblists — Phil Cohran’s wonderful albums from the 1960s. 
“You know, it’s tough trying to satisfy everybody with our music. It’s hard enough satisfying ourselves, let alone the jazz scene, the hip hop guys, what have you. With this album we just dropped all that as a consideration, and tuned into deeper principles.” ",Soul / Funk

The show bombed, lasting just two weeks; and with only a handful of copies punted, most of the reminder were later destroyed in a basement flood. 
It’s intriguing, youthful, left-field gospel-soul. A bit odd. The deep funk of Thoughs Were The Days is the coup de grâce.

Loma,Volume Four: Sweeter Than Sweet Things 1964-68,Future Days Recordings,"Loma was set up by Bob Krasnow at an address on Burbank in LA, overlooking Loma Avenue at the back. (He left in 1966 to set up Kama Sutra/Buddha, promptly signing Captain Beefheart’s Safe As Milk.) 
Early dabblings in R&B were a hangover from Krasnow’s time at King — and there were one-aways like Kim Fowley’s The Belfast Gipsies —  but Loma is best characterised as a Warners subsidiary, for four years expertly trained on the burgeoning soul singles market, especially rich in Northern Soul. 
The final volume of this excellent retrospective series offers plenty of unreleased material, including stars like Linda Jones and The Mighty Hannibal, dancers like The Marvellos’ I Need You and The Invincibles’ Heartstrings, and such classy exemplars of the Ragovoy-styled uptown sound as Carl Hall and Ben Aiken.",Soul / Funk

O.V. Wright,8 Men And 4 Women,Peacock,"Terrific deep soul LP from 1967, bluesy and gospelized, with timber-shiverers like I Could Write A Book, You’re Gonna Make Me Cry and the title track. ‘I could write a book about my troubles but I know I know lord the story would make you cry… Too many memories and some of them I know I know some of them I wouldn’t like… And I know there’s nothing nothing nothing nothing in between those pages would ever bring my my my baby back.’ A neglected singer these days (though not by Ghostface Killah), this is hotly recommended.",Soul / Funk

Originally released in 1978 in Japan only, like Herbie’s unmissable Directstep, with the same core personnel, including Bennie Maupin, Alphonse Mouzon, Webster Lewis, HH and Ray Obiedo, alongside the great bassist.

Pedro,One Kind Of Love,Musique Plastique,"Originally self-released in 1993 by Peter Mekwunye as a small-run cassette, soon after his arrival in the US from Nigeria. Intensely personal, moving, freeform afro-pop, or DIY soul, using just a Casio keyboard and a microphone, with a rawly naked message of love, struggle, spirituality and hope, ‘dedicated to all Nigerians all over the world, and to all freedom fighters around the world.’ Strange — a bit like eavesdropping on someone talking to himself — and warmly recommended.",Soul / Funk

Arthur Russell,Corn,Audika,"The sequel to Calling Out Of Context; another precious extraction from Arthur’s original, completed 1/4” tape masters. 
Russell himself compiled this material thirty years ago, on three separate test pressings, labelled El Dinosaur, Indian Ocean and Untitled: five brilliant alternate versions of key works — including This Is How We Walk On The Moon — and four offerings new to the world, triumphantly culminating in the rapt, restless Ocean Movie. Wonderful.",Soul / Funk
Arthur Russell,Instrumentals,Audika,"The first volume is a mid-seventies masterpiece, Americana touching on Copeland, Ives, and Brian Wilson, with AR ‘re-awakened to the bright-sound and magical qualities of the bubblegum and easy-listening currents in American popular music.’ Volume 2 is a moving, pastoral orchestral work, conducted here by Julius Eastman. Also included are two of Arthur’s most elusive compositions, recorded live in 1975: Reach One is a minimal, hypnotic ambient soundscape for two Fender Rhodes pianos; Sketch For Face Of Helen commemorates his colloborations with Arnold Dreyblatt, recorded with a keyboard, tone generator and — with echoes of Moondog — recordings of a tugboat rumbling across the waters of the Hudson River.",Soul / Funk

Stone classic vocal takes on Ronnie Laws’ Always There and the Crusaders’ Keep That Same Old Feeling, through sublime mid-tempo harmonising like She’s A Lady, to jiggy jiggy murder like S.O.S.

This reissue includes a new interview with Kathy Sledge, and adds ten bonus tracks to the original LP tracklisting, gathering the group’s remaining singles on Atco and Cotillion between 1973 and 1976, most of which have never been on CD before: stuff like the UK hit Mama Never Told Me, and the Bobby Eli productions Thank You For Today and Cream Of The Crop.",Soul / Funk

Sly's Stone Flower,I'm Just Like You (1969-70),Light In The Attic,"Truly pioneering electro-funk — treated, lo-fi, minimal, fundamentally desolate — this long overdue compilation of Sly’s own Stone Flower label runs the five 45s alongside ten previously unissued cuts, all newly remastered from the original tapes. The missing link between the rocky, soulful Stand! and the dark, ticking, overdubbed sound of There’s A Riot Going On, his masterpiece.

School-friends Clifford Curry and LaSalle Matthews started the group in 1965, with Walter Jones and Robert Thomas, all in for the long haul. They waited till 1970 for a hit — I’m Still Here, produced by Syl Johnson for Twinight — and had to ride out the label’s demise before signing to Curtom’s new Gemigo imprint in late 1973. (Super People was 1975.)
Unmistakably Chicagoan and stamped by Curtis, classically schooled but on the cusp… with its roots in the chivalric harmonies of doowop, its bad self in dapperly distraught r&b balladry, and its eye on the new social consciousness of soul and funk.

Ultra High Frequencies,The Chicago Party,Numero,"Guaranteed to put a beam on your bean and a glide in your stride, the DVD here compiles moments from a local 1982 TV show, broadcast live from a club called The CopHerBox. It’s pleasurable enough just watching people get down so naturally, in a real-life club… but you also get ventriloquists, contortionists, body-builders, impersonators, ‘the full-figured ladies fashion show’, comedy sketches, android group-dancing to techno, rubber chickens… and bands like Universal Togetherness miming to their latest records. There’s also a mini-documentary, complete with Phil Cohran section; and twenty-three full musical performances. (Finally the Dingwalls posse gets a glimpse of Luba Raushiek in action.) 
The CD and vinyls are culled from a trove of self-released 45s and small-time twelves; a die-cut cathode-ray jacket and six in-package stills are your tickets and souvenirs.
