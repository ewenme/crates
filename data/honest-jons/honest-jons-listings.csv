Black Cat Trail,,Mamlish,"Roars out of the traps with Elmore James and JT Brown on fire; then a brilliant version of Tommy Johnson’s Big Fat Mama, by Arthur Spires from Chicago; then Johnny Howard’s mad Vacation Blues, with said black cat fallen asleep on the sustain pedal of the piano. Other highlights are Robert Nighthawk’s mean slide guitar and moral rigour, Rev Utah Smith’s preaching, and the last recording of the great Baby Face Leroy Foster, with his luscious, slyly wasted drawl somewhere between Sonny Boy Williamson and Percy Mayfield."

Ray Charles,The Genius Sings The Blues,Atlantic,"A lucky seven of Ray Charles’ classic Atlantic LPs meticulously reissued by Rhino (amidst a sea of bootlegs). All kicking mono, 180g vinyl, with the iconic artwork properly buffed up.
If you get just one to start with, we’d recommend this, gathering together his bluesier cuts for the label, at the end of his stay.
The almighty, pitch-dark I Believe To My Soul is here, for example. Everybody needs a copy handy for emergencies.
‘Last night you were dreaming and I heard you say “Oh, Johnny”, when you know my name is Ray. That’s why I believe right now (I believe, yes, I believe), I say I believe right now (I believe, yes, I believe), well, I believe to my soul now… You’re tryin’ to make a fool of me. (I believe it)﻿.’"

Chicago Slickers,1948-1953,Nighthawk,"‘Sixteen classic recordings from Chicago’s heyday as a blues centre’; sides by the likes of Little Walter and Homesick James, on lost labels like Parkway, Tempotone and Random. 
‘Once I had a woman who treat me nice and kind / but these Chicago slickers made my baby change her mind.’
Stuffed with killers, but Johnny Shines’ Ramblin’ is downright unmissable."
Chicago Slickers,Volume 2: 1948-1955,Nighthawk,"A second volume of ‘the best and rarest Chicago blues of the early postwar era.’ Little Walter, Muddy Waters, Sunnyland Slim, Floyd Jones, Snoooky Pryor, Roosevelt Sykes… all present and correct. 
You need it for Johnny Shines’ Living In The White House, about setting society to rights, over the rocking saxophone of J.T. Brown. ‘I want to live in paradise, make servants out of kings and queens / Now don’t shake me please darlin / This is one time I want to finish my dream.’"
Christians Catch Hell,"Gospel Roots, 1976-79",Honest Jon's Records,"Utterly magnificent, sublimely soulful survey of the Gospel Roots label, subsidiary of the mighty TK Records at the height of the Miami Sound.
A&R was co-ordinated by Gospel legends Ira Tucker — from the Dixie Hummingbirds — and Ralph Bass, veteran producer with Savoy, King and Chess. The label was run by Timmy Thomas, who had recently smashed with Why Can’t We Live Together, for another TK spin-off, Glades. Operations were overseen by Henry Stone himself, unlikely King of Disco, who had recorded a young Ray Charles, and pushed forward James Brown. They drew in artists from all over the US, from St. Louis, Columbus, Memphis, Brooklyn, Cabrini Green in Chicago: unknowns like Camille Doughty, reluctant to jeopardise her job at GM (‘Generous Motors’) in Detroit, and huge-sellers like the revered Brooklyn All Stars, who started out on Peacock in 1958. 
Choral belters, deep ballads, harmony quartets, epic city-blues, gritty funk, powerhouse female soul… Killer-diller Philly like a scorching version of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes’ Wake Up Everybody; and Jean Austin’s raw Spirit Free, co-written by Ronnie Dyson, produced by Jesse James at Future Gold. Chicago Sound like The Fantastic Family Aires — named after the family’s furniture store on North Cicero, but reminiscent of the Staple Singers at their best — through to the full-blown glory of The Fountain Of Life Joy Choir, led by Marvin Yancy from The Independents, and featuring Natalie Cole… Singers like Versie Mae Gibson, from the Jordans, by rights up there with Irma, Etta and Ree… Bangers 100%-guaranteed to find their way into Theo Parrish sets; and mortal delirium for the prissiest of soul and gospel purists.
Beautifully presented… the LPs with a 12”-square, full-colour, sixteen-page album of photos and original artwork, the CD with a forty-page booklet — and truly outstanding notes, including insightful new interviews across the board; mastered at Abbey Road.
Dread and civitas, for Christmas; grit and transcendence."

Their ANF project finds them at their most distinctive and reaching, flooding this EP with ‘pulsating acid lines, blood-rushing breakbeat and cosmic synths, and melodies that linger long after the record is finished. The title track is slippery, acid-flecked house, while the floating rhythms and space-shuttle chatter of State Function evoke early-nineties Sputnik missions. The grooving hand-percussion and celestial pads of Mary Lynne and the spaced-out Chi-Motion are primed for the chill-out room, or any place where there’s a lava lamp and a beanbag. All told this is rich, space-age techno to take your dance floor somewhere in the past that feels like the future.’"

Two constantly shifting blends of Belfi’s multi-rhythmic snare-work with stately drones and shimmering electronica. Themes and traces continually loom and recede, rocking to a deep, pulsating bass drum, and tautened by a widescreen sense of drama (with Morricone in mind).
(‘Cera persa’, in Italian; ‘casa perdue’, in French: ‘lost-wax’ or ‘investment’ casting, by which a sculpture is duplicated.)"

But where Flash, Kool Herc and Bambaataa were back-spinning, mixing and scratching together breakbeat records, these first rap sides were all made using live bands, often replaying current disco tunes, whilst MCs rapped over the top…’"

Blank Mind founder Sam Purcell kicks off, with some orchestral music flanged to giddy abstraction, heralding the return of Alan Johnson, to test its weighty dynamism in freer, surreal mutations. On the flip, a two-drum-kit jam blazes with propulsive yet disintegrating energy. And, to close, the recording debut of Variete, put down on a Scandinavian Christmas Eve morning: a gently purposeful, reflective ascent."

DJ Sotofett & Maimouna Haugen,C'Est L'Aventure,Honest Jon's Records,"Boof.
Precious, timely, moody reflections on migrating from Côte d’Ivoire to Moss, in Norway, over ruff breakbeat funk supplied by the nimble bass-playing of Maimouna’s old man (from Kambo Super Sound), and the expert conga and kit-drumming of Stliletti-Ana (from Jesse, in Helsinki). Even in their delirium, b-boys and girls will savour traces of the Incredible Bongo Band, in the chorus. Over the eight minutes, and going deeper on the flip, the mix lifts off into a cosmic steppers dub, featuring Gilb-r alongside Sotofett on keyboards, with no let up for the dancefloor in energy and vibes.

F Planet itself is an in-for-the-kill stomper, husky and frantic, its sizzling bass and clanky hats inexorably dissolving in a sulphuric alarm of distortion and haywire bleeps. Astral Pilot ties you into a swirl of frequencies, rhythms and mechanical growling, before finally disentangling itself into some kind of cosmic lift-off. On the flip, grimly tightening the bolts, setting the controls inwards, and darkening and thickening its atmospheres into a kind of gut-churning possession, Shifted makes F Planet all his own. "

Rasmus Hedlund,Audio Kurator,Ljudverket,"Deep, dubwise techno, intently balanced and varied, its heart on its sleeve for analogue and vintage digital equipment and the Basic Channel tradition, but with strong Nordic flavours to its moodiness and murk, melodic soul and sense of vast, starred space."

Rasmus Hedlund,Intet Efter Allt,Ljudverket,"Ljudverket celebrates its tenth release with this characteristically skilled, open-air blend of field recordings and organic, dubwise techno in the tradition of Basic Channel, filled with keen senses of its own particular natural terrains and atmospheres.
‘The thunder and rain of Bas Emfas passes to blue skies above shimmering water, in Luminös Klang. The cerebral jam Konflux Sekvens gives way to the deep emotions of Sonisk Morgonsyn, to close the journey.’

World In Action takes in field recordings, woodwind freakouts and percussion from Valentina Magaletti amongst other elements’ (The Quietus)."
Hemingway,Memoirs,Cosmic Resonance,"This new label from Toronto is a thrilling prospect.

Insanlar / Ricardo Villalobos,Kime Ne,Honest Jon's Records,"Stunning new music from Istanbul! 
A twenty-four-minute wig-out you can dance to — wild baglama improvisation and mystical male-unison singing, atop the propulsive mass of a Berlin half-stepper, with turbulent detours into dub, radiophonics and psychedelia.
‘Kime Ne’ means ‘so what’, ‘what’s it got to do with you’. The song adapts verses from the seventeenth-century poet Kul Nesimi, wistfully invoking the Melami strain of Sufism as a touchstone of humility and tolerance, in dark times. ‘Insanlar’ means ‘humankind’... ‘The Human Beings’.
RV’s mixes are expert, taut and hard-grooving. 2 is the more agitated and dubwise.
Nearly an hour of music, on three sides; the fourth is etched with Katharina Immekus’ lovely artwork.
Knockout stuff, honestly."

Itinerant Dubs,Non Material Space,Itinerant Dub,"Hissing, worrisome dub-techno: less improvisational and mercurial than to date; more contemplative, stickier. NMS nods to 2000 Black-era Dego; Last Snare cuts vintage house vocals into a percussion stomper."

J.V.C. Force,Strong Island,B-Boy Records,Storming late-eighties hip-hop. Justified By Virtue Of Creativity For All Reasons Concerning Entertainment.
Jabu,Sleep Heavy,Blackest Ever Black,"‘Broken-hearted, downtempo r&b/street-soul and atmospheric, introspective electronics from singers Alex Rendall and Jasmine Butt, and producer Amos Childs. It’s a future Bristol classic with a universal resonance, with songs that are highly personal but deeply relatable, and tripped-out… Childs is one of the most gifted producers of his generation and his work here, grounded in hip-hop but floating free, is a thing of sustained wonder: crepuscular, melancholic – funereal, at times — subtly psychedelic and heavily dubwise, but always concise and purposeful, with influences from US R&B to Japanese art-pop minimalism, and a rich seam of underground UK soul, boogie, DIY/post-punk, library music and lovers rock.’ 
Now and again a bit cloying and confected, trip-hop and scandi-noir, it has to be said, and the label’s likening of Rendall’s singing to Teddy Pendergrass and The Temptations is way overcooked — more like a cross between Bryan Ferry and The Associates’ Billy Mackenzie — but surely this is one of the records of the year."

"Johenson, Leroy Versions",MELODYCAR01,Melodycar,"A new label from Stefan Schwander (out of Harmonious Thelonious) and his mate, cooked up during their deejay sets at the Salon Des Amateurs in Dusseldorf. 
Johenson chips in an infectious, glitchily dubwise, somewhat sacrilegious crossing of ska and Rhythm & Sound.

Kassem Mosse,Disclosure,Honest Jon's Records,"Fierce, subtle music, radically strange and unafraid of the deep, but with a killer understanding of rhythm. Lush drum-machine nocturnes, gnarly electronica and glorious flowerings of zoned-out dubspace: an evolutionary music, continuously engaged with experimentation both in the studio and the club.
Whether prepared solo, or jointly with his spar Mix Mup, a Kassem Mosse recording is less of a stand-alone creation than the next thrilling installment of an unstoppable groove. True to form, Disclosure dazzlingly extends some of the most mystical, essential dancefloor-rooted music of the last decade, from dusty, dream-state techno on Workshop and Mikrodisko, to frazzled beatdowns on Trilogy Tapes and Nonplus.
Pedigree techno and house are the lifeblood of Disclosure, yet with something newly microscopic about them. Its mesmerising juggle of pointillistic percussion, melting-wax chords and fleshy bump’n’grind suggests biological processes at work, as if Mosse has zoomed right into the cellular metabolism ticking away at the core of the music.
These textures are woven into some of KM’s richest and most emotionally complex material so far, constantly enlivened by forays into jazz, dub and beyond. Check the farty-bottom, broken-down, steel-pan minimalism of Collapsing Dual Core, just the job for coursing around Detroit in a car at night; and Phoenicia Wireless’ dastardly, intricate combination of glowering John Carpenter synths, heavy static and junked consoles on remote, as if the beats are fighting a wave of dirt, soot and fossilisation. The frantic, interstella tarantella of Galaxy Series 7; the wonky bump-and-hustle and heavy-lidded drama of Purple Graphene, to close. 
Expertly pieced-together and paced, Disclosure brilliantly registers all the self-contained coherence and artistic authority of an album proper, yet shadowed throughout by the open-ended and questing spirit so vital to Mosse’s music. Its intimate enactments of non-closure, and its sense that anything could happen at any moment; its thematic play between excess and incompleteness, babble and tongue-tied stutter, and-you-don’t-stop grooving and entropy, wobble and the pause-button.
Trash and ready in a spiffy Bankhead sleeve, too.
Double bim. Bim, bim."
Kassem Mosse,Chilazon,Honest Jon's Records,"Pure worries from Leipzig — three club burners steeped in Detroit traditions, distilling the explorations in collective, nervy hypnosis of KM live sets. As the music slowly unfurls, there he is at every turn, subtly tweaking its parameters, redistributing its weight, pricking its grooves into a state of utterly infectious perpetual movement.
The two visions of Chilazon track opposite pathways: the first is twelve minutes of gorgeous, dubwise, aquatic techno, spattered with kicks and razor-sharp hi-hats, and smeared with ghostly echoes; then a terse mesh of broken drums, escalating to a quiet yet feverishly intense peak. Lanthanum is calligraphic swordplay, its toms and bass stabs warily circling one another in a graceful steppers’ dance, spaced-out and fathoms-deep."

Suspenseful story-telling by way of early electronic music and krautrock, tribal drumming, minimalism and microtonality, and seams of dance and club music.

Mark Ernestus Versus Obadikah,April,Honest Jon's Records,"Consummate Berlin dub science by the maestro. 
Beautifully textured, shuffling Lagos funk, on home-made percussion… militant horns… and a walloping, filthy-stinking kick-drum like the bucking, hairy hind-most of the Devil himself.
The Dub is Warrior Charge, 2016.
What a record. Bim squared."
Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force,Lamb Ji,Ndagga,NA
Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force,Walo Walo Version,Ndagga,"Three killers heralding the next phase of this dazzling expression of a dream Dakar-Berlin nexus. All instrumental — though the opener has snatches of singing — with the vocal versions held back for the new album. 
The music just gets deadlier and deadlier — harder-boiled and deeper; more focussed, confident and dubwise.
Evoking the ancient cultural legacy of the griots, ‘Walo Walo’ is also the name of the sabar rhythm underlying the opener, which features Ibou Mbaye’s percussive synth-work, Mangone Ndiaye Dieng’s kit-drumming, and Bada Seck’s rigorous jolts of lower-pitched Thiol drum. The ‘Groove’ version is tough as nails; well and truly gnarly.
A tribute to the Baye Fall leader, Ndiguel Groove is a sparse, mellow interpretation of the most traditional cut on the album, showcasing Assane Ndoye Cisse’s insinuating guitar lines, Laye Lo’s super-elasticated snare-drumming, and Bada Seck playing the khine drums associated with the Baye Fall. (Short and wide; lightweight but low-pitched.)
Pretty awesome."

Moritz Von Oswald Trio,Horizontal Structures,Honest Jon's Records,"At its most open, shifting and expressive to date. For all the music’s complexity and deep coherence, freedom is the key. At times it grooves hard; at others it’s lush, romantic. With Tikiman and Marc Muellbauer."

"Moritz von Oswald, Ordo Sakhna",,Honest Jon's Records,"A kind of intimate scrapbook of the startling collaboration between the techno maestro and this long-standing musical collective based in Bishkek, devoted to the roots music of Kyrgyzstan. Loose-leaved but balanced, lucid and intimate, it sets out from stunning a cappella and virtuosic komuz and kylak, mouth harp and traditional percussion: not field, but expert studio recordings, using marvellous vintage microphones, made over several days in Berlin. Further, a few of these are deftly treated by Moritz, using Reichian de-synced double-tracking, and discreet effects. Also two ten-minute dubs: a deadly, signature Berlin steppers, plus its version; and an echoing, mystical drum session, recorded live on stage in Bishkek. And a side-long, dream-like summation: the locomotive, oceanic, clangorous, dread Facets. 
Ravishing, rooted, searching music; beautifully presented."
Morphosis,Dismantle,Honest Jon's Records,"Two sick techno killers, stalking the perimeters of noise; and generous excerpts from a soundtrack to Dreyer’s Vampyr, with Sun Ra in its marrow, alternately driving and motorik, off-the-wall, lost in space."

Anthony Naples,Take Me With You,ANS,"‘Originally meant to be a mixtape for Naples’ friends, inspired by their afterhours hangs. It ended up being closer to a proper album, and possibly his loveliest record yet. The personal element helps explain its warmth: this is dubbed-out ambient music that glows with a sense of deep comfort, instilling relaxation as well as the energy to keep on hanging out. It’s easy to listen to, but it’s far from easy listening, teasing out the melodic gift that Naples has shown since his very first track’ (Resident Advisor)."

Nuel,Unveiled,Latency,"A stone scorcher of an EP to put alongside his classic Aquaplanos with Donato Dozzy, from nearly ten years ago. 
Four contrasting, deeply atmospheric stages in longing — swingeing and propulsive to blissed-out and bittersweet. Terse but charged; hypnotic, never bludgeoning; soulful and warmly crafted, never mechanical.
Says Nuel — ‘Unveiled consists of live recordings made on the same great day: 03/10/2015. The inspiration comes from a woman, the record is my reaction to something she unveiled. The record is about really strong feelings, relationships and mental projections… a sexy record for me. After that recording session I found these tracks so appealing that I decided to keep them in that form, a document of that day.’
In hand-made, silk-screened sleeves — tastily inky and rough — featuring a bust from the gardens of the Villa Medici in Rome… stern, erect, gaze averted. 
Another killer from the redoubtable Latency. 
Very warmly recommended."
Nukubus,Para,Laura Lies In,"Aka Jan Katsma of Bunker associates Syncom Data, stepping out with his first full solo release in three years. Six feverish, dubwise synth excursions, rumbling with restrained power; with passages as body-rocking as recent Katsma/SD contributions to mixtapes by Dettmann and Stingray, but always verging on acid disintegration."

But even at its most angst-ridden it feels lithe and aerodynamic, its darker impulses both intensified, and offset, by a pure soundboy’s delight in detail and colour and higher dancefloor mechanics. The music pulses with energy, a fever to communicate… and Raki Singh (violin), Jasmine (vocals) and Ollie Moore (saxophone) add vivid flesh-tone to the punishing, plasmic electronics.’"
Outboxx And Atki 2,Tribute To Disc Shop Zero,Idle Hands,"A tribute to Naoki E-Jima’s Disc Shop Zero record store in Tokyo, stalwart champion of Bristol music over the years.
Rob Smith from Smith & Mighty reworks something from Outboxx’ debut LP into a shimmering stepper, with beautiful cascading arpeggios and nuff bass, and arresting fragments of vocal drifting in and out of the mix.

Pessimist,,Blackest Ever Black,"‘Out of its relentlessly noir, paranoid, smoked-out dubscape emerge fierce, Babylon-shall-fall jungle tear-outs (Through The Fog); acidic rave (Peter Hitchens); downtempo breakbeat (Glued); sleek, rude steppers (Spirals); and passages of bleak, bombed-out industrial ambience. At times it feels like the missing link between British Murder Boys and Source Direct, or what might have happened if late 90s UK junglists had listened more closely to Chain Reaction. But really, it sounds like Pessimist and Pessimist alone. The ruthless minimalism, and the tension which comes of that restraint; the swing and propulsion of the drum programming; the abyssal reverbs and long trails of delay; the deep and body-numbing sub-bass; the uncompromising palette of blacks and blues…’"

Regis,Manbait,Blackest Ever Black,"Reviewing his work for the label from 2010-2015. A bouquet of original Regis, and his remixes of Raime, Vatican Shadow, Ike Yard and Dalhous. Plus three previously unreleased tracks: a brand new take on a lost song by his teenage synth-punk group Family Sex, an alternate mix of Tropic of Cancer’s Plant Lilies At My Head, and — on the CD and via the LP’s download code — a new edit of his own Blinding Horses."

Rhythms Of The Pacific,Volume 1,Pacific Rhythm,"Brilliant, discofried, jacking house, featuring Vancouver tuffies LNRDCROY, Cloudface, Hashman Deejay and Memory Man."
Rhythms Of The Pacific,Volume 2,Pacific Rhythm,"‘Another critical sampling of Vancouver’s evergreen dance music community. The A-side unearths two Canadian classics-in-waiting from Neo Image, with some dreamily broken garage and sparkling, heady ambience. Florist and D Tiffany split the flip — low-key, breakadawn shufflers. Both sides are guaranteed to kick up dust on the dancefloor, and once again 100% CANCON certified!’"
Rhythms Of The Pacific,Volume 3,Pacific Rhythm,"Another sampling of the ‘Vancouver Sound’, as it is not known. 
The recording debut of Slim Media Player, with two deep (but not too deep) club cuts, toeing the line between ‘just about heady enough’ and ‘I’ll play this one later when more people are here’. 
Electric Sound Broadcast kicks off the flip with a thoughtful tribute to his favourite recreational vehicle; before Khotin brings us ashore with a track referred to as the ‘EP standout’ by someone on the internet."
Riddim Box,Excursions In The UK Funky Underground,Soul Jazz,NA
Rider Shafique,I-Dentity,Young Echo,"The terrific opening salvo of this thrilling prospect of a label, imprint of the eleven-strong, Bristol-based collective.
Intensely intimate, dread ruminations about racism, being and the UK — rooted in the dub poetry of LKJ and Mutubaruka — in tense, widescreen settings by Amos Childs, out of Jabu and O$VMV$M, and Sam Kidel, moonlighting from The Death Of Rave. 
Hotly recommended."

Samo DJ,Kicked Out Of Everywhere,The Trilogy Tapes,Samo lived in Hong Kong for a bit. He rescued a dog and brought him back to Stockholm. He skates but that’s not him on the front.

The Upsetter meets Raymond Scott meets Horsepower Productions… on a writhing, pinging bed of Spaghetti Western… at the synthy grassroots of Library. Next-level stuff from Seekers, after excellent releases for Bokeh and Boomarm. Tremendously enjoyable; warmly recommended."

Shackleton,Music For The Quiet Hour,Woe To The Septic Heart,"Thrilling, oppositional dance music, heady with dread and drama, flash-lit with nods in all directions — mbira, steel pan, drone, Berlin techno, pipe organ, guitar improv, the call-to-prayer, early Steve Reich…"
Shackleton,Deliverance Series No. 1,Woe To The Septic Heart,NA

Shackleton & Vengeance Tenfold,Sferic Ghost Transmits,Honest Jon's Records,"No-one else makes music like this: devilishly complex but warm and intuitive, stirring together a dizzying assembly of outernational and outerspace influences, whilst retaining the subby funk-and-hot-breath pressure of Shackleton’s soundboy, club roots. 
The result is an evolutionary, truly alchemical music — great shifting tides of dub, minimalist composition and choral song (Five Demiurgic Options); ritual spells to ward off the darkness (Before The Dam Broke, The Prophet Sequence); radiophonia and zoned-out guitar improv (Seven Virgins); even the febrile, freeform psychedelia of eighties noise rock (Sferic Ghost Transmits / Fear The Crown).
Over the five years since Music For The Quiet Hour, Vengeance’s vocal and lyrical range has rolled out across this new terrain. Throughout these six transmissions he’s hoarse preacher, sage scholar and ravaged bluesman; blind man marching off to war, and exhausted time-traveller warning of impending socio-ecological catastrophe. 
Six dialogic accounts of our conflicted times, then, expanding beyond the treacly unease of the duo’s early collaborative work into something subtler and more emotionally shattering — its shades of brightness more dazzling, and its darkness even murkier.
“We almost didn’t hear it when the foundations went.”"
Shackleton With Anika,Behind The Glass,Woe To The Septic Heart,NA
Shackleton With Ernesto Tomasini,Devotional Songs,Honest Jon's Records,"Shackleton’s most expansive, ecstatic and hallucinatory music to date. Four extended excursions channeling Congotronics way to the east, with an aura of restrained mania reminiscent of the feral pomp and gallows humour of Coil’s moon-musick phase.
The pairing with Tomasini is a match made in heaven. Swooping from deep growl to piercing falsetto, his four-octave voice both heightens the taste for the theatrical that’s always been integral to Shackleton’s music, and makes explicit the latter’s kinship to the occult energies of the UK’s post-industrial underground.
As the title suggests, these are shadowy songs rich with allusions to bodily ritual and psychic exploration, with Tomasini’s lyrics framed by luminous whirls of hand-struck drums and synthetic gamelan, bells and tumbling organ melodies, all earthed by dubwise bass. You Are The One escalates from delicate choral chant to full-bore psychedelic organ freakout; Rinse Out All Contaminants is a slow incantation, to purge all negative thoughts; the melodies of Father You Have Left Me are smudged like early Steve Reich, then burned out by snarling subs; and the magnificent Twelve Shared Addictions balances elliptical melodies like spinning plates, gradually unfurling into a breakneck storm of voice and hammered keys."
"Shackleton, King Midas Sound",Deadman,Honest Jon's Records,"Signature Shackleton — paranoia flaring into dancefloor fire, gripping and rolling. With a chilled and crackling King Midas Sound, Hitomi forlorn. And finally The Bug himself, digital only, getting in your face."
"Shackleton, T++, Mordant Music",Fireworks,Honest Jon's Records,"A malevolent scorcher, with Middle Eastern percussion harking back to Hamas Rule; a ravening, scrabbling T++ remix. And a new departure — rich and spry, computer-unbound — with a  truly epic, stunning Mordant."
Shadowlust,Trust In Pain,L.I.E.S.,"One half Svengalisghost, with an electronic erotic cabaret. ‘Pulsing tones, off beat drums, melancholic vocals, and overall dark vibes characterize but do not exhaust what it is to truly trust in pain.’"

DJ Sotofett,Drippin' For A Tripp,Honest Jon's Records,"Epic, protean brilliance from the Sotofett corner, bumping nylon New Age and ill Chill Out up against reggaeton and jungle exotica, spilling batucada-style percussion workouts out of clean-heeled house. 
Each side spins the wheel and introduces a new collaborator or two — Phillip Lauer from Tuff City Kids is here; Gilb’r from Versatile (on a new version of Pulehouse)... 
The knockout punch is there on side three: Nondo — which means ‘Heaven’, ‘Eternity’ — starts out as an electro-lullaby from Côte d’Ivoire, sotto voce and abuzz, before lifting off as a zinging, anthemic, future-house-classic. 
A real tour de force all round, gusting in from Moss."
DJ Sotofett,Dub Off,Honest Jon's Records,"Three murderous steppers dubs on a propulsive, rat-tat-tat rhythm, combining mystical spaciousness with detail and ferocity. Angry-lion bass and smears of brass, fusillades and explosions, scares and shocks, oriental pentatonics, clattering percussion and synthy transcendence… the business. The second mix is nastiest; the third is the wildest and most discombobulated (and our favourite).

Tuomo Vaananen,Beacon,Ljudverket,"His second EP for this excellent Finnish label. 
‘Four tracks of arctic tropicalia constructed during last summer’s heatwave. Badly behaving analogue synths and echos were layered with noisy field recordings and improvised percussion instruments. Some dub was also thrown in. When temperatures finally started dropping, files were sent to Scape Mastering.’"
Tuomo Vaananen,A Small Flood,Ljudverket,"Typically outstanding, cultured, listenable techno by the co-founder of this excellent Finnish label, adroitly traversing dub and ambient. Nothing lunky or domineering, dystopian or Gothic, this debut LP generates senses of immediate, natural being out of field recordings (Waiting Halls, Winners, Temple) and the foibles and hiccups of the music-making process itself (New to the System, Sloth, A Small Flood)."

‘Freaked, chopped ‘n’ screwed RnB, but with its sensuality and slickness intact, for maximum dancefloor worries. 
‘Four anonymous, strongly individual commissions from around the world: A1 is dubwise; Hit It Tool runs bumping 2step drums into Bmore breaks; B1 floats pitched-up vocal samples and misty-eyed rave chords, up and away; 2ON calls time with a wan club shuffle.’"

Just over fifteen minutes long, Mabomba Dance gradually layers Mutua’s needle-sharp percussion over a deep analogue bass pulse, building into a hypnotic dancefloor workout.
The flip showcases the Nyatiti harp of Nyatrapasa, before delving into a kind of minimalist Afrobeat. Traditional Nubian percussion and Mekha’s stellar vocals draw the EP to a close."

Zov Zov,Fata Morgana,Berceuse Heroique,"The industrial project of Oliver Ho and Tommy Gillard at its most subversive and evocative, with two preoccupations threaded throughout: Middle-Eastern percussion, most vivid in the chimes of Casting and the driving doumbek rhythms of Burning and The Sands; and the structural iteration of chaos, underlying a collage of wild left-turns, scornful of repetitive hooks and other musical routines. 
Early birds bag a 7” by Ho’s Desert Burials, evoking classic punk/funk hybrids like Cabaret Voltaire."

Dave Bixby,Ode To Quetzalcoatl,New Fortune,"The loner/downer, acid-casualty folk classic, from 1969.
‘Recorded in DB’s living room on four-track, with loads of reverb, the sound is lo-fi and sparse — just acoustic guitars, with occasional harmonica and flute, behind Bixby’s haunting, emotional vocals, spiritual lyrics and solid songwriting. The opening cut, the eerie and painful Drug Song sets the mood perfectly for the rest of the album. Never again has an acoustic folk album sounded as intense as this.’"

Elizabeth Cotten,Vol. 2: Shake Sugaree,Smithsonian Folkways Recordings,"From age seven EC taught herself to play cornshuckin’ country-rag-time on her brother’s banjo (whilst he was out). At eleven she bought herself a guitar, and again she taught herself, left-handedly holding it upside-down, mostly open-tuned, playing syncopated bass with her fingers and melody with her thumb — ‘cotten-picking’ it like a banjo. Having given up music for church and family, forty years later she found work in the musical household of composer Ruth Crawford Seeger (a Joanna Newsom favourite), and re-learned. 
There are wonderful instrumentals here, including three from church — but, covered by the likes of Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead, the original Shake Sugaree is singularly sublime and unmissable. Co-written with her young grand-children, it’s both lulling near-nonsense and devastatingly poignant, with deadly measures of regret and longing, innocence and debauchery. (Twelve-year-old Brenda’s pawned everything she can lay her hands on, and raised Cain with the proceeds; now she’s ‘going to heaven in a brown pea shell’. Still — listen — she can’t bring herself to sing the word ‘hell’.)"

Crying Lion,The Golden Boat,Honest Jon's Records,"Refreshing, rootedly odd, mostly unaccompanied four-part-harmony singing recorded in Govan Old Parish Church, Glasgow, by members of Trembling Bells and Muldoon’s Picnic. Elements of Sacred Harp, Gregorian chant, medieval madrigal and English folk, with poetic influences including Maya Deren, Saint John The Divine and Dennis Potter — a unique blend of the visionary and the earthly, the intimate and glorious.

Both the title track and the self-deprecating Drowning In The Mainstream speak of Wilson’s hope to inch at least a few steps towards the big time without making too many compromises.

Emmanuelle Parrenin,Perelandra,Souffle Continu,"Previously unreleased recordings from 1978, 1981 and 1982, conceived for choreographers. The bandoneon-playing of the Argentinian Juan Mosalini, electric piano by Jacques Denjean, electroacoustics by Bruno Menny and none other than Didier Malherbe from Gong are swirled into a mix of spinet dulcimer, flute, hurdy-gurdy and other-worldly singing (amongst other ingredients), all steeping together in the sonic atmosphere of a vintage acid-folk freak-out."

Rob Noyes,The Feudal Spirit,Poon Village,"‘Rob Noyes from eastern Massachussetts sometimes seems to have absorbed an almost infinite reservoir of influences. Apart from some superb Basho-like 12-string tunneling, most momentary fragments tend to recall legendary Limeys like John Renbourn (and through him, Davey Graham), because Rob’s overt melodic structures tend towards the non-bluesoid. But then you’ll maybe hear a note-sequence spiced like something dropped from the hot strings of Michael Chapman or even a powerful throng that makes you think of Wizz Jones. When that happens, you realize there’s more of a blues base to some of the songs than you’d been able to untangle. Mr. Noyes hits a vast array of sub-genres on this album, and he hits them all pretty damn hard. Rob’s playing carries the weight of many possibly-imaginary forebears, but the way he smears them all together shows a holistic mastery of touch and imagination that defies a lot of today’s players, who tend to shine in short bursts, then allow their dreams to outrun their technique’ (Byron Coley)."

Salm,Volume Two: Gaelic Psalms From The Hebrides Of Scotland,Arc Light Editions,"From the same spontaneous, unrehearsed sessions as the first volume, in the Back Free Church on the Isle of Lewis in October 2003.
‘A precentor leads off with the first lines of a psalm, and the congregation follows, some faster than others, each one discernible. The precenting here is particularly influenced by the pibroch style of free ornamentation, as the distinctive emotional swell of sound emerges. The sound relies on the congregation’s individual responses to the melody and the individual precentor’s leading. The musical term is free heterophony.’"

Six Organs Of Admittance,Hexadic,Drag City,"‘The first thing is how unhinged it all sounds. The album brews and boils with an ominously dark tone in a desolate space, dense with energy, guitar overdriven past the point of sanity, slamming drum accents, vocals cutting through in what seems to be comprised of another, as yet unheard, language. Yet, inside the apparent wild abandon and destruction is a strict internal logic of construction that unveils itself upon listening…’ With Noel Von Harmonson from Comets On Fire on drums, and  Rob Fisk from Badgerlore sharing the bass-playing with San Francisco psych legend Charlie Saufley."

So it was that when A&M’s Burrito Brothers debut The Gilded Palace of Sin made it to shelves in February of 1969, early adherents to the Cosmic American gospel were already echoing its message from areas flanking Gram Parsons’ Southern California hills and canyons. There was F.J. McMahon in coastal Santa Barbara, Mistress Mary further inland in Hacienda Heights, and Plain Jane of Albuquerque, New Mexico…’"

About Group,RAK,Treader,"‘This second AG recording for Treader sees Charles Hayward passing the drumsticks to Rupert Clervaux. Together with Coxon’s simple and insistent guitar themes, the elegant drum-work underpins four extended group compositions, containing a surprising collision of sounds and influences, bringing together Pat Thomas from the Improv scene, Floating Points-collaborator Susumu Mukai, and Alexis Taylor’s mooger-foogered rhodes. Somehow it all crystallises perfectly. The clearest precedent for this engaging recording is Ege Bamyasi-era Can, but really it occupies a position all its own.’"

Long out-of-print; pressed at Pallas.
“We played all over Europe,” remembered Bowie. “Our situation in Europe was completely unique among groups; the way we carried ourselves, the way we conducted our business. Most cats were in the regular jazz thing: you come, get a hotel room, and blah blah blah. But we had children, a dog; we lived in the country. It was unusual because most of the jazz cats were sitting around Paris, and we had a nice big estate, cherry trees and apple trees, ha… instead of squandering our money, we would collectively get together and buy things that the group needed— instruments and equipment. We had a Volkswagen, and we bought two more trucks over there… We could travel anywhere, and this is mostly, I think, the reason we were so successful. We could be hired for Germany; all we had to do was pack and come over, whereas to a lot of groups it would have meant trains and planes. We spent the whole summer of 1970 just traveling. We did radio and TV concerts all over.”"

Derek Bailey,Solo Guitar Volume 1,Honest Jon's Records,"Kicking off a series of collaborations between Honest Jon’s and Incus: three double LPs of the legendary free-improvising guitarist Derek Bailey, solo and in duos with Anthony Braxton and Han Bennink, augmenting the original releases with marvellous, previously unissued music. As throughout the series, the recordings are newly transferred from tape at Abbey Road, and re-mastered by Rashad Becker. The records are manufactured by Pallas."
Derek Bailey,Aida,Honest Jon's Records,"At last, the vinyl reissue of this masterwork, adding two hitherto unreleased gems recorded solo for Charles Fox’s Radio 3 programme Jazz in Britain, in the same few months of 1980 as the stunning Aida performances.
The phrase ‘in the moment’ is often bandied about with reference to free improvisation, and indeed there’s no better way to describe Derek Bailey’s playing. The acoustic guitar is notoriously lacking in natural reverberation — notes barely hang in the air for a couple of seconds before they disappear — which explains the almost non-stop flow of new material in these stellar performances.  Bailey knew from one split-second to the next exactly where to find the same pitch on different strings, either as a stopped tone or a ringing harmonic, and there’s never a note out of place. ‘He who kisses the joy as it flies,’ in the words of William Blake, ‘Lives in eternity’s sunrise’ — and this music is forever in the moment, constantly active but never gabby, kissing the joy.
One of the special pleasures of the BBC set is the guitarist’s own laconic commentary, a deliciously deadpan description of what he’s doing while he’s doing it — “I like to think of it… as a kind of music” — and the interaction between words and music is a particular delight. “You may have noticed a certain lack of variety,” he quips, while unleashing a furiously complex volley. Is it a coincidence that the final seconds recall the famous cycling fifths of the coda to Thelonious Monk’s Round Midnight? Surely not — for Bailey, like Monk, was a note man par excellence. And they’re both still alive and well in eternity’s sunrise."
Derek Bailey,Lot 74,Honest Jon's Records,"This iconic LP was originally released by Incus in 1974. Recorded at a private house in Catford, south-east London, the side-long title track is a masterwork: a twenty-two-minute, starkly personal, freely expressive, itchily searching re-casting of orders of rhythm and sound into a new, quicksilver kind of affective and musical polyphony. Never mind the guitarist’s championing of ‘non-idiomatic improvisation’, the poet Peter Riley gets the ball rolling in his identification of the various hauntings of Bailey’s playing at this time: ‘mandolins & balalaikas strumming in the distance, George Formby’s banjo, Leadbelly’s steel 12-string, koto, lute, classical guitar… and others quite outside the field of the plucked string.’ 
The five pieces on side two were recorded back home in Hackney around the same time — with the exception of Improvisation 104(b), from the year before (and issued by Incus in its TAPS series of mini reel-to-reel tapes) — opening with ventriloquised guitar feedback, and taking in some cod banter about colleagues like Mervyn Parker, Siegfried Brotzmann and Harry Bentink. 
Crucial."
Derek Bailey & Han Bennink,,Honest Jon's Records,"The tussling vegetables in Mal Dean’s cover-sketch somehow befit perfectly this extraordinary duo of Bailey and the great Dutch drummer Han Bennink. Recorded in London in 1972, Incus 9 was their second record (after an ICP in 1969), becoming a blueprint and inspiration for generations of free-improvisers. It is paired here with a brilliant session from the following year, with the same power and friendly combativeness, and oodles of creativity, technique and humour. It’s obvious how much they loved playing together."

"Derek Bailey, Tristan Honsinger",Duo,Honest Jon's Records,"Born in Burlington, Vermont, and conservatory-trained in the US, the cellist Tristan Honsinger moved from Montreal to Amsterdam in 1974, quickly linking with Han Bennink and Misha Mengelberg, and opening a long and fruitful musical relationship with Derek Bailey. Recorded in 1976, Duo displays a performative musical approach already characterised by the lack of inhibition which would later endear him to The Pop Group: he is knockabout, exclamatory, explosively rhythmic; burping Bach and folk melodies with spasmodic lyricism, in amongst the garrulous textures and accents of his scraping, bowing and plucking, and gibbering like a monkey; throwing out his arms and stamping the floor, grappling with his instrument like an expert clown, always on the lookout for new ways to trip himself up. You can hear Bailey revelling in the company, as he ranges between scrabbling solidarity and an askance skewering of his partner’s antics, on prepared (nineteen-string) and standard electric guitars — and a Waisvisz Crackle-box, for the garbled, quizzical, cross-species natter which closes The Shadow. Throughout, the spirited interplay between laconic, analytic wit and guttural, sometimes slapstick physicality is consistently droll, often laugh-out-loud funny; vigorously alert, alive and gripping."

Derek Bailey & Jamie Muir,Dart Drug,Honest Jon's Records,"Percussionist Jamie Muir was a member of King Crimson during the recording of Larks’ Tongues In Aspic, in 1973. Staying less than a year with Robert Fripp, the Scot had already cut his teeth with another master guitarist, Derek Bailey, as part of the Music Improvisation Company, along with Evan Parker, Hugh Davies and Christine Jeffrey, whose eponymous 1970 album was one of the first releases on ECM. Muir and Bailey recorded Dart Drug eleven years later, in 1981.
There’s no shortage of great percussionists in the brief history of free improvised music but on the strength of Dart Drug alone Jamie Muir deserves a place at High Table. Unlike for example Han Bennink and John Stevens, though, you can’t hear echoes of any particular jazz drummer in Muir’s playing, even if he has expressed appreciation for Milford Graves (who himself sounded like nobody else who’d come before him).
What on earth did Muir’s kit consist of? Some instruments are clearly identifiable (bells, gongs, chimes, woodblocks); others could be… well, anything. Old suitcases thwacked with rolled up newspapers? Tin cans and hubcaps inside a washing machine? Who cares? It sounds terrific – but if you’re the kind of person who faints at the sound of nails scraping a blackboard, you might want to nip out and put the kettle on towards the end of the title track.
Dart Drug is consistently thrilling, and often very amusing – but it’s certainly not easy listening. In music we talk about playing with other musicians, whereas in sport you play against another opponent (or with your team against another team). Why not play against in music, too? That’s precisely what happens very often in improvised music, and Bailey was particularly good at it. How can a humble acoustic guitar hope to compete with a Muir in full flight?  Sometimes Bailey’s content to sit on those open strings, teasing out yet another exquisite Webernian constellation of ringing harmonics and wait for the dust to settle in Muir’s junkyard, but elsewhere he sets off into uncharted territory himself.
“The way to discover the undiscovered in performing terms is to immediately reject all situations as you identify them (the cloud of unknowing) – which is to give music a future.” Bailey evidently concurred with this spoken statement by Muir, including it in his book Improvisation.
Derek Bailey is no longer with us, of course, and Muir gave up performing music back in 1989. All the more reason for seeking out this magnificent, wild album."

Barney Wilen,Moshi,Souffle Continu,"Inspired, free, luminous music-making. An outernational holy grail and a stiff tonic for all citizens of nowhere. 
Already the great French jazz saxophonist had made monumental records alongside all-time legends like Monk, Blakey, Bud Powell and Miles — that’s Wilen on Lift To The Scaffold — before cutting loose at the end of the sixties on a two-year journey through Morocco, Algeria, Niger, Mali, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Senegal, with a team of film-makers, technicians and musicians. 
Moshi means trance utterance — the moshi is a demon invoked by the Fulani Borogi of Niger, to chase away angst and depression — and this is a shamanistic bricolage of smoky musical spells and scraps of intimate, outdoors ambience, full of love, good vibes and gritty musical wonder, drawn from more than fifty tape reels recorded en route: desert blues, space-jazz, street-funk, acid rock, polyphonic rhythms and new-thing influences like Shepp and Sanders; buzzing, extended ensemble sessions, like alternative Bitches Brews, crossed with diverse snippets of magic grabbed on the wing, like Algerian gnawa, or solo mbira, or just people laughing together, or a Bamako griot… 
Beautifully presented, with a twenty-page booklet, and the DVD of Caroline de Bendern’s vivid, freewheeling film A L’Intention De Mlle Issoufou A Bilma, about the trip.

Bayou Maharajah,The Life And Music Of New Orleans Piano Legend James Booker,Cadiz Music,"Unmissable film! 
A rawly soulful, moving tribute to the out-of-this-world artistry of James Carroll Booker, with dazzling clips of him in performance, various compelling interviews with his inner circle — where celebration and awe are cut with bitter frustration — and beautifully judged footage of the New Orleans locale.
In his autobiography, Queen Of The Junkers Joo Joo, Booker wrote: ‘It never occurred to me, until the age of four or five, that I was not a female, plus equipped to talk. The first woman I wanted to marry without doing it against my will was actually Tallulah Bankhead and another chick was a dude who identified herself as the Toast, the muffin or the Footloose Fancy Fruitcake among other commodities. Since then I heard she has not yet entered the Unorthodox Book of the almost Living.’ 
Booker liked dressing up as a woman called Juanita; he got nicked for impersonating plod. He did a stretch in Angola State Penitentiary, for drugs. He told people that Ringo Starr put his eye out, in a fight. He was way larger than life; just like his stunning piano-playing never shuts down into either ragtime or jazz, blues or classical (especially Chopin), and his singing is free as a bird.
Booker was born in 1939, around the time Jelly Roll Morton died (as he liked to note). Aged fourteen, his first recording under his own name was Doing The Hambone, for Dave Bartholomew. That’s really him playing piano on a bunch of Fats Domino and Little Richard records. He accompanied everyone from Bobby Bland, to Ray Charles, to Aretha. Amongst scores of 45s, his 1960 organ instrumental Gonzo — named after a mythical smack addict — was Hunter Thompson’s theme-song, and a smash for Peacock. Dr. John called Booker ‘the best black, gay, one-eyed junkie piano genius New Orleans has ever produced’ (which is faint praise).     
Big Easy portions of staggering, utter musical genius, sexual transgressiveness, drugs and booze, suffering, waste and mania. 
James Booker… such a don.
Watch it!"

With its unconventional lineup featuring steel drums, Latin percussion, and French horns, along with the co-leaders’ drum-kit and piano, it is among the most wonderful outings of its decade. Pullen was in top form, his inside-outside approach to the keyboard perhaps optimally heard on the exuberant Double Arc Jake, where the bright melody suddenly breaks into pieces, snapping back into miraculous shape.

Reviews seem unanimous that it’s the best yet.
‘Characteristically action-packed in the Berne tradition (following on from AACM and his muse Julius Hemphill): powerful, dynamic, often fast-moving  — yet also very clear in all its teeming detail. “We somehow achieved more sonic space by adding another player,” says Berne. It’s an impression maintained even when producer David Torn takes up his own guitar in a cameo at the climax of the modestly-titled Sideshow (in reality a 26-minute epic journey), soloing amid thunderous timpani, over a serpentine melody outlined by sax and clarinet.’"

Veteran of all those classic Horace Silver, Max Roach and Ntu Troop recordings, his baritone voice is mostly reined in here, but rivetingly, acutely soulful."
Andy Bey,Experience And Judgement,Be With Records,"Slower and funkier than the Gary Bartz excursion a few years earlier — with Bad Wilbur Bascomb popping away on electric bass, not Ron Carter — this unmissable 1974 version of Celestial Blues was a game-changing revive in the early nineties, a cosmic crossing of Bill Withers, Sly and Brian Jackson, threading trip hop and Jazz Dance through to Madlib.
‘C’mon meditate! Let’s contemplate!’"
Andy Bey,Shades Of Bey,Koko,"Reputedly Trane’s favourite singer, Andy Bey illuminates such talismanic recordings as Members, Don’t Git Weary, with Max Roach, Won’t You Open Up Your Senses, with Horace Silver, and of course Celestial Blues, with and without Gary Bartz. 
This 1998 album is magisterial, showcasing Bey’s four-octave baritone/falsetto range pushed to its expressive limits. The compositions are dazzlingly diverse, opening and closing with the caressing intimacies of a Brazilian love-song and an Afro-Cuban lullaby, by way of Midnight Blue, a Monk and an Ellington, and the modal classic Half And Half; a knockout version of the beautiful song Some Other Time; a staggering excursion on Blood Count; and a gently rocking interpretation of Nick Drake’s River Man. Gary Bartz and Geri Allen both sparkle.
This first vinyl release is handsomely presented by Koko — its debut — and luxuriantly cut at 45rpm."
Bheki Mseleku,Celebration,Matsuli,"The story goes that Alice Coltrane gave her late husband’s saxophone mouthpiece to Bheki, recognising in the South African pianist ‘a kindred spirit to John Coltrane.’ 
His first release under his own name, Celebration was recorded and produced by World Circuit, who originally issued it on compact disc and cassette in 1992. 
Roiling with an historical sense of transition and upheaval, the sessions brought together musicians from SA, London and the US in the same months as the dismantling of apartheid, as if to put in lights the accession of South Africa to the to-and-fro of Black Atlantic culture. Counterposed to the album’s disclosure of the personal toll of exile, its evocations of inner peace and transendence are unmistakably marked by Trane and Pharoah Sanders, but elsewhere European classical forms and township marabi and mbhaqanga come to the fore.
‘The first thing that struck me about this album was the feeling of the music,’ says Shabaka Hutchings. ‘It had so much joy. It felt like it was so much more than the intricacies of how he was creating the music; it invoked the feeling of why this music was being made.’"

Both sessions were recorded completely live, straight to tape, consolidating the ‘incandescent immediacy’ of the playing. The duo’s ‘soulful tenor sax sermons plus earthily funky drumming, fusing jazz, hip-hop and grime… winningly mix dark, classic Coltrane raptures, infectious hook-rooted rockers and Sonny Rollins-like calypsos.

Bitter Funeral Beer Band With Don Cherry,Live In Frankfurt 82,Black Sweat,"Deeply influenced by Hindustani, Carnatic and West African music, the Swedish percussionist Bengt Berger founded the BFBB in 1980, based on his ideas about the traditional, cathartic funeral music of the people of Lo-Birifor, in the northern region of Ghana. For this legendary recording the group is joined by the one and only Don Cherry, and K. Sridhar, master of the indian sarod.

Sticking to the flute, he’s joined by the great drummer Kenny Clarke, Sadi Lallemand alternating with Michel Hausser (who also doubles on xylophone) on vibes, and Paul Rovere alternating with Jymie Merritt on bass, as well as percussionist Humberto Canto. The Belgian’s gorgeous, soft arrangements bring another dimension to his own originals, standards such as There Will Never Be Another You, and classic jazz tunes, like an exotic Misterioso and a Latin- flavoured Chasin’ The Bird. Perhaps his finest recording under his own name.’"

Marion Brown,Three For Shepp,Superior Viaduct,"‘In 1966, when Marion Brown was ready to make his first record as a leader, he was standing on the shoulders of giants. Formative associations with Ornette Coleman and Sun Ra established Brown as a saxophonist to watch, and he had already appeared on free jazz landmarks Archie Shepp’s Fire Music and John Coltrane’s Ascension. Originally released on Impulse!, Brown’s debut lays down three startling originals and three tunes by Shepp — echoing his mentor’s 1964 homage to Coltrane, Four For Trane. Featuring Grachan Moncur III on trombone, Dave Burrell on piano and Sirone on bass, Three for Shepp balances fiery energy and delicate precision. Side A showcases Brown compositions that mix modal structures with ecstatic playing, particularly when the bandleader chases Moncur and Burrell on the exhilarating ‘The Shadow Knows.’ On the album’s all-Shepp side, ‘West India’ draws inspiration from India and Africa, while the feverish post-bop of ‘Delicado’ demonstrates the band’s versatility, swept by the wheeling drums of Beaver Harris. Even this early in his career, Brown stood apart from his peers in ‘the new thing.’ His solos were as gentle as they were furious. Informed by the African American folk traditions of his native Georgia and an enthusiastic embrace of the avant-garde, his music would confront and challenge society. As Brown says in the original liner notes, ‘The music is definitely a part of what’s going on in the black revolution in America.’ Three for Shepp still sounds crucial today (over fifty years later) and remains a vital statement of jazz’s past, present and future.’"

Cecil Payne,Zodiac,Strata-East,"CP came through professionally in the 1940s, most notably with Dizzy Gillespie. Amongst scores of recordings, he’s on Randy Weston’s Uhuru Afrika, Kenny Dorham’s Afro Cuban, and Baritones And French Horns, with Trane. Here, leading a seriously distinguished lineup — Dorham, Albert Kuumba Heath, Wynton Kelly and Wilbur Ware, produced by Clifford Jordan — he naturally brings his own retrospective gravitas to the late-sixtes jazz ferment, underlined by his opening each side here with tributes: Martin Luther King, with its strongly Milesian lines, and Slide Hampton, featuring some scintillating piano work. Both Dorham and Kelly died between the recording and release of this album — which honours Eric Dolphy, also recently deceased — and the music itself poignantly hinges together different eras in jazz, proposing new paths forward in the tight funk of Girl, You Got A Home, and rollicking Carib jazz of Flying Fish, to close. No bells and whistles; just lovely stuff."

Don Cherry,Complete Communion,Blue Note,"DC’s first album as leader, after leaving the Ornette Coleman Quartet. Two side-long suites, recorded in single takes on Christmas Eve, 1965.

Clive Zanda,Here With Dat Kinda Ting: Calypso Jazz Innovations,Cree,"This Trini pianist is a graduate of the island’s glittering late-1950s musical milieu, spear-headed by the likes of Rupert Clemendore and John Buddy Williams. In the early sixties he was in London, fronting the Tropical Strings, playing bluebeat and calypso in pubs and clubs. Visiting the US in 1974, he formed a jazz group with Louis Hayes.
Here is his own trio, recording in 1976, back in Trinidad. Top-notch jazz piano playing, bluesy and spontaneous, imbued with folk and calypso rhythms (and including tunes by Kitch and Sparrow), with dashes of Latin and funk, and hefty bass. Worth sticking around for the lovely closer, Ogun."
Billy Cobham,Stratus,Atlantic,"Heavy jazz-funk — exemplary breaks’n'beats, sampled by Massive Attack on Safe From Harm — taken from the drummer’s 1973 album Spectrum. BC was on the rebound from the Mahavishnu Orchestra, along with keyboardist Jan Hammer. That’s Tommy Bolin from Deep Purple on guitar."
Cohelmec Ensemble,Hippotigris Zebra Zebra,Souffle Continu,"COH as in Jean Cohen (saxophones), EL as in Dominique Elbaz (piano) and MEC as in the brothers François and Jean-Louis Méchali (bass and drums) — joined by the American clarinettist and flautist Evan Chandlee for this debut album, originally released by Saravah in 1969.
“We wanted to avoid that kind of ‘free’ which is characterized by pounding drumming and a saxophonist freaking out in the high register, that type of music that kicks off suddenly then stops without us being able to sense the motivation. There is never any difference in intensity: nothing is destroyed, nothing is created, nothing is elaborated, nothing is questioned — when, even on the simple level of sound, there is so much that can be done.”
With French roots running back through the music of Jef Gilson, and pitched at the time somewhere between ESP and Actuel/BYG, with full-blooded nods to the likes of Cecil Taylor, John Coltrane and Walt Dickerson, this is expert, exuberant music-making, searching out its own way. 
Ten tracks, even-handedly improvised and composed, beautifully played; intense and free-spirited but always engaging, attentive and communicative. 
Top-notch sound; heavyweight gatefold sleeve with obi-strip; twelve-page booklet."
Cohelmec Ensemble,Next,Souffle Continu,"Their second LP, from 1971, with guitarist Joseph Dejean from the Full Moon Ensemble propelling the music forwards, as pianist Dominique Elbaz stands down.
The sound swells and contracts dramatically across the eleven tracks and interludes, with fresh senses of break-down and silence, and new intimacy. There is some Steve Lacy to its fierce repetition of key phrases; some Sharrock to Dejean; sparing experimentation with effects; portions of central African polyphony (Boa Constrictor), summer-breeze funk (Desert Angel), and plenty of characteristically rootsy prog and cosmic skronk."
Cohelmec Ensemble,5 Octobre 1974,Souffle Continu,"A live recording of a concert given at the Theatre de l’Est Parisien.
Stretched-out but closely textured and highly evocative, more bluesy than before, and brooding with Milesian intensity. 
There is a strong spirituality to all of Cohelmec’s music  ... but here they go deep.
Try Teotihuacan. Killer."

The classic quartet in 1963; and a bonafide lost album, not a bunch of recycling and barrel scraping. 
Still hooked on melody and lyricism — like Impressions, Ballads and John Coltrane And Johnny Hartman, all from the same year — but seeded with the intense spirituality of A Love Supreme, next up.
With two completely unheard original compositions; a first studio version of One Up, One Down; Nature Boy, straight as an arrow; and the fine-tuning of Impressions.

Alice Coltrane,Universal Consciousness,Superior Viaduct,"Please don’t miss this fiercely magnificent music from 1971, with Jimmy Garrison, Jack DeJohnette, Leroy Jenkins and co, and Ornette guiding the strings arrangements.
Here’s David Toop’s contribution to The Wire’s ‘100 Records That Set the World on Fire’: Universal Consciousness clearly connects to other dyspeptic jazz traditions — the organ trio, the soloists with strings — yet volleys them into outer space, ancient Egypt, the Ganges, the great beyond. The production is astounding, the quality of improvisation is riveting, the string arrangements are apocalyptic rather than saccharine, the balance of turbulence and calm a genuine dialectic that later mystic/exotic post-jazz copped out of pursuing. Her lack of constraint was dimly regarded by adherents of ‘70s jazz and its masculine orthodoxies, yet Alice deserved better credit for virtuosity, originality, and the sheer will power needed to realize her vision.’"

Trumpeter Michael Marre calls it the musical expression of a kind of anarchist delirium. “It was like a fuck-you to to all the current nationalist trends, and for me, my roots being in Aveyron, it was an opportunity to mix, to interconnect everything… not closing any doors… just playing… There’s something like energy, something wild, that you don’t really find any more, currently. The fact that we work from the basic form of the quintet, but then subvert it, and that our first theme hails Coltrane, but at the same time is half from Andalusia — all that was us playing jazz, but on our own terms.”"

Derek Bailey & Cyro Baptista,Cyro,Honest Jon's Records,"When Cyro Baptista moved to New York in 1980 from his home city of São Paulo, he brought with him an arsenal of percussion instruments, including the cuica (friction drum), surdo (the booming bass drum associated with samba), berimbau (single-string bow with resonating gourd), and cabasas galore, in the next few years deploying them most notably in numerous ensembles curated by John Zorn, who helped set up this studio session in 1982.
As you might expect from someone whose infectious grooves have graced the work of Herbie Hancock, Astrud Gilberto and Cassandra Wilson, Baptista expertly fires off cunning polyrhythms, even traces of thumping samba, with restless fluency. Bailey the wily old fox skirts and eschews the bait, which is quickly conjured away and newly fashioned. The guitarist homes in on the delicious squeaks of the cuica and the twanging drones of the berimbau with truly awesome tonal precision. You could sing along if you wanted, after a caipirinha or two. And he gets almost as many different sounds from his instrument as Baptista can from his kit – check out the stratospheric plings and string-length fret-sweeps of Tonto, which sound more like a prepared piano than an acoustic guitar. 
Wonders abound, from the berimbau/bent-string exchanges that open Quanto Tempo to the delightful collision of howling cuica and spiky bebop on Polvo, and the spare, preposterous Webernian samba of Improvisation 3.
These days, ‘improvisation’ often appears without its customary qualifier ‘free’. If there were ever a case to be made for its reinstatement, this album is the best supporting evidence. Freedom means you’re free to get into the groove, free not to, free to play with each other, free to play against each other. Sometimes frustrating, even scary, but more often than not in the hands of these two great masters it’s hilarious, exhilarating and utterly irresistible."
Derek Bailey & Tony Coe,Time,Honest Jon's Records,"Multi-reedist Tony Coe was born in 1934, four years after guitarist Derek Bailey. He cut his teeth as a career jazzman with Humphrey Lyttleton, before an extended stint with the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band. On this rare 1979 duo outing, he sticks to clarinet. And though that instrument has an illustrious jazz pedigree, Coe’s playing here is something else.
It’s worth noting that the clarinettist has also played under the baton of arch-modernist Pierre Boulez, the kind of composer Derek Bailey enjoyed taking to task in his book Improvisation. You might think the Frenchman’s uncompromising serialism and the free playing Bailey defended with such passion all his life would have little in common, yet both men were hugely influenced by Anton Webern. It’s an influence you can hear right through Bailey’s career in his obsessive exploration of tight parcels of registrally-fixed pitches, notably those trademark ringing harmonics. Meanwhile, Coe’s meandering semitones and sinuous arabesques here recall both Boulez’s clarinet writing in Domaines, and the harmonic world of Boulez’s own teacher Olivier Messiaen. 
Still, no traditional classical musical notation could ever render the extraordinary rhythmic subtlety and timbral complexity of this music. It’s at one and the same time dazzlingly virtuosic — Coe and Bailey are on stellar form throughout, and have enough sense to, yes, accompany each other where needs be — and supremely lyrical and spacious. 
An absolute delight."
Dharma,Mr. Robinson,Souffle Continu,"“We try to reach within free jazz the same sort of rhythmic cohesion as in bop… based not exactly on tempo, but something which feels like tempo. A kind of underlying pulse.”
This is Dharma’s first LP: from the same neck of the woods as the Cohelmec Ensemble, a mixture of spiritual jazz, free jazz and electric Miles — especially for its keyboards — infused by the anti-authoritarian politics of collectivism and anti-hierarchism.
Saxophonists Jef Sicard and Gérard Coppéré are moonlighting from Claude Delcloo’s Full Moon Ensemble."
Dharma,Snoopy's Time,Souffle Continu,"Their second LP, released three months after Mr. Robinson in 1970. 
Funky jazz-rock — tight, direct, restless. Pianist Patricio Villarroel lays on the Corea / Jarrett vibes; alongside bassist Michel Gladieux and drummer Jacques Mahieux."
Dharma,End Starting,Souffle Continu,NA
Dharma,Archipel,Souffle Continu,"‘Winding operations down after End Starting, Archipel is likewise planned-out music, mixing free rock and European free jazz in a series of collective explosions based on abrupt and contrasting improvisations. For much of the time, piano, guitar and saxophone intertwine over intense rhythms. Everything is electric, with the density of On The Corner, and flashes of viciousness all its own. 
‘Along with the Cohelmec Ensemble, the Workshop de Lyon, the Full Moon Ensemble, Perception, Armonicord or the Michel Portal Unit, the Dharma Quintet stands out as one of the most important examples of free jazz as it was played in France at the beginning of the 1970s.’"
Walt Dickerson,Unity,Chiaroscuro,"A moody, ambitious, intriguing record, originally released by Audio Fidelity in 1964. 
Just two side-long tracks — and an amazing lineup, with Walter Davis on piano, bassist George Tucker, and two drummers together, Edgar Bateman and the great Andrew Cyrille. 
The sleeve-notes quote a Downbeat article from the same year, claiming that Dickerson was the most important vibraphonist since Milt Jackson: ‘instead of solos made up of one related note following another, Dickerson often builds areas of sound, placing them one on the other, creating a total effect.’"

The LP sold by the thousands within weeks, becoming South Africans’ unofficial national anthem."
Dollar Brand,The Journey,Chiaroscuro,"Magnificent jazz from 1977 by this nonet including Don Cherry, Johnny Dyani — both top-form — Hamiett Bluiett and Roy Brooks. The grooving, rolling, side-long Hajj — with eastern-style oboe — is knockout."

"Don Byron, Aruan Ortiz",Random Dances And (A)Tonalities,Intakt,"Brainy but intensely pleasurable piano-saxophone/clarinet duets; judiciously allusive, searching and rigorous.
Ortiz is a protégé of Muhal Richard Adams whose playing riddles Noncarrow with rumba, Messiaen with Monk, Yancey with yambu. Don Byron is a favourite of ours way back to Tuskegee Experiments and his revival of Mickey Katz. 
The opening tribute to Catalonian jazz pianist Tete Montoliu — who smuggled flamenco into post-bop — is twinned with something from Musica Callada, by Federico Mompou, a kind of Catalonian Satie. (“The complexity of simplicity,” Ortiz calls it. “Mompou’s music doesn’t land the way we expect it to, and the resolution is like a door to what’s happening next. Mompou’s pieces have a lot of these doors, and they give a lot of space to creativity.”) There are interpretations of Black And Tan Fantasy (by way of Thelonious Monk Plays Duke Ellington), Benny Golson’s Along Came Betty and Geri Allen’s Dolphy’s Dance; and a luminous arrangement of a Bach violin partita for solo clarinet. Byron chips in compositions dedicated to Lorraine Hansberry and Andy Capp; Ortiz some twelve-tone serialism and a tune based on ‘the triangular relationship within a series of three notes’. 
Invigorating music; brilliantly recorded."

Duck Baker,Duck Baker Plays Monk,Triple Point,"Solo acoustic guitar renditions of nine Thelonious Monk tunes. 
‘Baker will remind you through his playing that the idiosyncrasies of Monk’s composing are further dimensions of the Americana continuum (and source musics) that has been his turf for years. Especially in Monk’s centennial year, many will address Monk’s oeuvre, in fact hundreds will interpret the scores, but very few can inhabit this music in the way Duck Baker does here.’ "
Duck Baker,Spinning Song: Duck Baker Plays The Music Of Herbie Nichols,Triple Point,"Superlative solo acoustic guitar interpretations of the compositions of the brilliant, offbeat pianist. (Herbie’s two mid-fifties Blue Note LPs are unmissable; dazzlingly just a totter sideways of Monk. He co-wrote Lady Sings The Blues with Billie Holiday.)
Acoustic Guitar magazine called it ‘one of the best guitar records ever recorded — by anybody.’
“Nowadays a lot of people are giving Nichols’ music the attention it deserves, but only Duck Baker’s playing makes me feel Herbie in the room” (Roswell Rudd).

Elsewhere, he appears to be dragging the side of a cymbal against a bass drum skin, producing low groans that complement the glistening high end… In Air, Oak, Metal, Hair, Prevost’s cymbals whistle and shimmer as they catch the breeze.
‘Other tracks nod towards Prevost’s jazz background. MaxPlus draws inspiration from a Max Roach hi-hat study… Rotology touches on a range of drumming traditions, from East Asia to West Africa’ (The Wire)."
Teddy Edwards,"Love Moods, Good Gravy!",Fresh Sound Records,"The great tenor saxophonist’s two 1961 albums for Contemporary — with stellar West Coast sidemen like Art Pepper, Phineas Newborn, Frank Butler, Frank Rosolino — showcasing singer Helyne Stewart on the first."
Teddy Edwards,The Inimitable,Elemental,NA
Teddy Edwards,Teddy's Ready!,Boplicity," Bouncing back from illness, the great Angeleno’s superb 1960 debut for Contemporary, with the unsung pianist Joe Castro, and the mighty Leroy Vinnegar and Billy Higgins. Bluesy, no frills, West Coast class. Stick around for the cover of Hampton Hawes’ The Sermon, and the Higgins original, to close."
Eero Koivistoinen,Wahoo!,Svart,"‘Jazz funk’ doesn’t do this justice, at all. It’s fierily spiritual jazz, super-heavyweight funk from 1972, with the Finnish saxophonist wailing and testifying atop tasty Fender Rhodes by Olli Ahvenlahti, and percussion by the legendary Sabu Martinez. 
Heartily recommended; this is a classic."

Featuring Johnny Hodges, in Strayhorn’s sublime arrangement, Blood Count is utterly devastating, every time. Another masterpiece of despair, cut by wistfulness, After All is stone-cold classic Ellingtonia.

Whether paying tribute to his mentor Lee Konitz on Honestlee, impressionistically conveying the glittering Melody Of A Waterfall, or generating impactful drama out of fragments of sound on Butterfly Effect, Weber continually draws fresh responses from his players.

Griot Galaxy’s willingness to push boundaries was as affectionate as it was fearless. Kins is Detroit’s post-Coltrane, high-on-Sun-Ra bridge into the ‘80s. They certainly weren’t the first to experiment with polyrhythms, odd meters, and unusual tonalities, but it was in part the combination of Jaribu Shahid and Tani Tabbal’s previous experience with Sun Ra, as well as Tabbal’s experience with one-time Arkestra trumpeter Phil Cohran, that allowed the group to blossom…’"

"Hamid Drake, Joe McPhee",Keep Going,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘The session somehow consolidated their shared energy in an unexpected way — the drummer’s incredible warmth and sense of buoyancy, the saxophonist and trumpeter’s preternatural musicality and quest for social justice. The recording started with McPhee reciting words by Harriett Tubman, resulting in the title track; Drake’s support was an achingly slow Max Roach-like beat. From this inspired, inspiring starting point, the twosome frolicked through a rich program, McPhee donning tenor and alto saxes, and pocket trumpet, Drake turning momentarily to the frame drum. Each musician contributes an introspective solo track. McPhee at one point plays trumpet into an open gong, which gives him otherworldly overtones, a sort of acoustic version of electric Miles…’"

Herbie Hancock,Speak Like A Child,Blue Note,"After two years’ preoccupation with the Miles Davis Quartet, here is Herbie in 1968, getting ready for the seventies, the old bebop instincts melting into the balmy, open, innocent textures of fluegelhorn, bass trombone and alto flute, and his own lightly beautiful playing."

Herbie Hancock,Crossings,Warners,"‘Herbie took the basic instrumental tracks of Quasar and Water Torture to Patrick
Gleeson’s Different Fur Studios, hoping to learn how to play the Moog synthesizer. Instead, Hancock let Gleeson contribute layers of sound to both pieces: on Quasar extending the horn playing of Bennie Maupin, Julian Priester and Eddie Henderson through electronic accents; on Water Torture providing a ghostly counter melody on the Mellotron (using samples from string instruments). These studio enhancements give Crossings an
otherworldly dimension, making the album feel bigger and more fantastical, yet the Sextet’s playing — recorded without much in way of edits or overdubs — keeps everything grounded. Indeed, Gleason’s additions are often so natural that it is hard to pick out what’s acoustic and what’s synthesized.’
The second LP by the sextet aka the Mwandishi Band, and Herbie’s last for Warner Brothers, clearing the way for the Headunters."
Herbie Hancock,Man-Child,Columbia,NA
Herbie Hancock,Thrust,Columbia,NA
Herbie Hancock,Mwandishi,Warners,"‘After releasing their Warner Bros. debut, the Herbie Hancock Sextet underwent a major transformation in the early ’70s. Over the course of a year, every member was replaced (except Herbie Hancock himself and bassist Buster Williams) and each adopted Swahili names. Hancock chose the moniker Mwandishi (‘composer’), and the Sextet became unofficially known as the Mwandishi Band.
‘The lineup’s first album reflects Hancock’s new aesthetic and spiritual directions. Stretching out from the r&b/jazz-fusion of Fat Albert Rotunda, the pianist would draw inspiration from his time with Miles Davis…
‘Dedicated to Angela Davis, Ostinato is an extended jam with stunning rhythmic complexity — enhanced by such studio effects as Echoplex delay. On You’ll Know When You Get There, Hancock’s tight arrangements are saturated in reverb, which gives an ever-shifting dimensionality. Side-long closer Wandering Spirit Song, written by trombonist Julian Priester, goes even further out: alternating between dynamic soloing and group improvisation, the Sextet fully manifests the radical potential of their collective identity/energy.
‘A bold and expansive statement, even after nearly fifty years.’"
Herbie Hancock,Head Hunters,Columbia,NA
Herbie Hancock,Fat Albert Rotunda,Warners,"‘A playful, joyous album in which Hancock clearly had a great time, this music was composed for the pilot of a children’s TV show, redirecting the post-bop of his five-year stint with Miles towards new r&b and funk styles. Flying high with three horn players — Joe Henderson, Garrett Brown and Johnny Coles — alongside Hancock’s soaring Fender Rhodes, the group could swing freely on a track like the rousing Fat Mama and emote precisely on the subtle Tell Me A Bedtime Story.’"

Acoustic and unfiltered electric guitars turned back into the supremely malleable instruments they were before they’d been firmly encoded as tools for rock or pop or jazz. Reichel uses a homemade 11-string guitar (with three pickups) for all the tunes except the first one. Reichel is like an improvising Harry Partch, investigating the genesis of lute music.’"
Harlem In Vogue,The Poetry And Jazz Of Langston Hughes,Fingertips,"The Harlem Renaissance giant, four ways. Leonard Feather’s sextet, Charles Mingus with Horace Parlan, Bob Dorough’s hip Jazz Canto, and poetry readings by LH himself (including I Have Known Rivers). Lovely stuff."

Helen Merrill,Parole E Musica,Dol,"Recorded in Italy in 1960, with arrangements by Piero Umiliani (who plays a mean celeste), this is a desert-island-disc of jazz singing. Longing, frustration and loneliness, saturated with sadness, ravishingly conveyed. You can feel her breath on your face.

Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra,Live At IUCC,Outernational Sounds,"Horace Tapscott is one of the unsung giants of jazz music. A gifted composer and arranger, a boldly original pianist, and above all a visionary bandleader, Tapscott’s recorded footprint is small, but his legacy continues to vibrate through the Los Angeles music underground. From Freestyle Fellowship to Build An Ark, Kamasi Washington and Dwight Trible, it all runs back to Tapscott. The pianist was an organiser, and instead of chasing a successful recording career, he wanted to build a community band that would act as “a cultural safe house for the music.” “I wanted to say, This is your music. This is black music, and I want to present a panorama of the whole thing right here.” “We would preserve the music on our ark, the mothership…”, aka the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra.
Tapscott had founded the group in 1961 as the Underground Musicians Association (UGMA). It changed its name to the Pan African Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and through the seventies the players lived, played and worked together. Community work and political consciousness were at the heart of the project, and for two decades they played in street, park and coffee house. With Tapscott as their guide and mentor, the Arkestra worked with theatre groups, poets and revolutionaries, ran music workshops and teaching sessions for children and adults, and played fundraisers, benefits and rallies for political and social causes both global and local. 
From 1973 to 1981 their main rehearsal and concert space was the Immanuel United Church of Christ (I.U.C.C.) on 85th St and Holmes Ave. The Arkestra played there every second Sunday, developing their sound and hipping new audiences to their vision. Live At IUCC, recorded in early 1979, was the only live recording the band released. In full flow, and at the height of their powers, the group recorded here features original 1961 UGMA members Linda Hill, David Bryant and Alan Hines, alongside the powerful voices of a new generation including Jesse Sharps, Sabir Mateen, and Adele Sebastian. 
Showcasing spiritualised classics from the Arkestra’s songbook, including heavy modal groovers Desert Fairy Princess and Macrame, Live At IUCC is a rare chance to hear one of the most important, foundational bands in all of jazz, stretching out in their own thing. With the great Horace Tapscott at the piano, this is the rarely captured sound of the mothership in full flight! 
Beautifully presented,180g audiophile vinyl.
Licensed from Tom Albach, who started Nimbus Records specifically in order to document Tapscott and his circle."
Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra,The Call,Outernational Sounds,"Available on vinyl for the first time in forty years, Horace Tapscott’s burning, spiritualised 1978 set is a masterpiece of the Los Angeles jazz underground.
It’s drawn from two studio sessions in April 1978, one at Hollywood Sage and Sound, one at United Western. The latter session added a string section, which can be heard on the moody Cal Massey composition Nakatini Suite and Jesse Sharps’ swinging modal trip Peyote Song No. III, with its swirling soprano solo. In keeping with the communal nature of the Arkestra, the other two compositions, The Call and Quagmire Manor at Five A.M. are also by Arkestra members. But at the centre of the music is the builder of the Ark, the visionary whose original call to action started a movement whose legacy continues to this day — Horace Tapscott.

Heed The Call!"
Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra,Flight 17,Outernational Sounds,"First formed as the Underground Musicians Association in the early 1960s, Tapscott always wanted his group to be a community project. From its base in Watts, UGMA got down at the grassroots. They played for the people, organising fundraisers in parks and coffee houses, hosting teach-ins and workshops for young and old, and mixing it with radical theatre groups, firebrand poets, political radicals, Black separatists, community groups and churches. They lived communally, supporting each other and their people, and built an ark for the Black arts in the heart of the city. The group was renamed the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra in 1971, and soon after they established a monthly residency at the Immanuel United Church of Christ which ran for over a decade, while still playing all over Los Angeles and beyond. But through all this, they never released a note of music.
It was the intervention of Tom Albach, a fan of Tapscott and the group, that finally got them on wax. Determined that their work should be documented, Albach founded Nimbus Records specifically to release the music of Tapscott, the Arkestra, and the individuals that comprised it. The first recording sessions in early 1978 yielded enough material for two albums, and the first release was Flight 17. From the surging avant-gardism of Herbie Baker’s opener to the laid-back summertime groove of Kamonta Lawrence Polk’s Maui, or Roberto Miranda’s uptempo Latin jam Horacio, Flight 17 showcased the radical voices of the Arkestra’s members. 
Available on LP for the first time in forty years, in a lovingly re-created gatefold sleeve, adding two tracks never before on vinyl, this is the first flight on wax of the West Coast’s foundational community big band — energised, hip and together.

Bobby Hutcherson,Components,Blue Note,"Five-star business with James Spaulding, Freddie Hubbard, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Joe Chambers, in 1965. The first side is all Hutcherson compositions — including Little B’s Poem, his lovely signature tune for his toddler Barry — the second all Chambers’, more abstract and reaching."
Hypnotic Brass Ensemble,Book Of Sound,Honest Jon's Records,"“We started with a cosmic idea that we were taught from a very young age – that the stars and planets make a sound, that deep in outer space there is audible harmony.” 
Book Of Sound is the brilliant, richly resonant exploration of these interstellar low ways. By turns urgent and contemplative, funky and reflective; varied in its textures, but entirely of one piece. Underpinned by cosmology, held in place by meditation, swirling with notions of history, science, theology, ancestry — this is a heady conceptual brew. But the music speaks loudest: ‘the sound of surprise’, magnificently retrieving Spiritual Jazz from the knacker’s yard.
It’s a deeply Chicagoan record. “It’s got the vibe of the lake,’ continues trombonist Cid, “the vibe of the prairies opening up to the west.” Also the Sun Ra albums recorded there in the 1950s, and — of course, being the dad of all seven ensemblists — Phil Cohran’s wonderful albums from the 1960s. 
“You know, it’s tough trying to satisfy everybody with our music. It’s hard enough satisfying ourselves, let alone the jazz scene, the hip hop guys, what have you. With this album we just dropped all that as a consideration, and tuned into deeper principles.” "
I.P. Son Group,,Black Sweat,"Originally released in 1975, from Milan, a one-away blend of Marco Rossi’s bluesy, free, spiritual jazz-guitar (evoking Pharaoh Sanders and Alice Coltrane); middle-eastern winds; and the masterful African percussionists Nick Eyok and Mohammed El Targhi, ranging from northern Saharan to Yoruba styles. Experimental, but warmly grooving, rootsy and accessible."

‘One of the landmark records of Mengelberg tunes, with classics like Rumboon and Alexander’s Marschbefehel, midpoint between Fluxus and Kurt Weill,Tetterettet presents a program full of musical surprises, intelligence, and ICP’s own brand of uproarious humor. A shaggy masterpiece, available here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, remastered from the original tapes, with Han Bennink’s original cover design.’"
Idris Ackamoor,The Periphery Of The Periphery,Sagittarius A-Star,"‘What really gave the music its fire and spirit was the spontaneity after the head of the composition was played. During the solos we would take it anywhere! Everywhere! Nowhere! Somewhere! Just fire breathing, bopping and weaving, hoofing and dreaming! It was a remarkable time. A beautiful time after the tragedy of 9/11. It was as if we were playing to the spirits of all of those departed. We are here! Still standing! Still blowing to the spirits!

‘Break Stuff’: what happens after formal considerations… a time for action… breakdowns, breakbeats, break dancing…
Hood is a humbly bamboozled tribute to Robert Hood. Work is for Iyer’s beloved Thelonious Monk. Countdown sets Trane to a West African rhythm. Mystery Woman is driven by the compound pulses of South Indian drumming. There’s a desolate, barely-there solo version of Billy Strayhorn’s Blood Count…"

As a member of the Club St Germain house band he was quickly spotted by Eric Dolphy; everyone from René Thomas to Walt Dickerson took his number. During the 1960s he collaborated with Jef Gilson, François Tusques, Barney Wilen, Steve Lacy… He features on Sonny Sharrock’s Monkey-Pockie-Boo and Don Cherry’s Universal Rhythm.
Recorded in 1971, his first album under his own name (and a title pinched from Henri Michaux) is an extraordinary, odd, elaborate sonic collage, using just a handful of instruments including drums, organ and piano, and a tape recorder, but a wide open field of musical reference, including funk, machine music, prog and free jazz. It’s all ears to Barraqué (an acquaintance), Ravel and Debussy. Its solitary mappings of a fragile melancholy can be compared to Robert Wyatt’s The End Of An Ear; but really it’s an intensely personal affair,
Warmly recommended."

Five tracks of soul jazz and modal fusion — re-modelling Trane, and opening with a variation of Norwegian Wood — by a local group including trumpeter Jeff Tyzik and pianist Sonny Kompanek; then Resnick mostly solo for the second side, when the money ran out, multi-tracking synthesizers on his home set-up, in an engrossing blend of reflective abstraction, grooving electro and spiritualised fourth-world tropicalism.

This was the period of such classic PAPA recordings as Flight 17, Live At IUCC and The Call; lit up by the funky, deep spirituality of Sharps compositions like Desert Fairy Princess, Macramé and Peyote Song II.
His own Sharps And Flats album was recorded in 1985 for Tom Albach’s legendary Nimbus West imprint, adding a stunning sixteen-minute bonus cut by the Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra, featuring Horace Tapscott, recorded in 1979.

Joe Farrell,Outback,CTI,"Killer lineup with Chick Corea, Buster Williams, Elvin Jones and Airto Moreira; recorded by Rudy Van Gelder. Spaced-out and questing but funky and taut… twixt Return To Forever and Miles (with Trane loud and clear on Sound Down). A key CTI, from 1972."
Joe Harriott: Fire In His Soul,Alan Robertson,Northway,Fine biography of the Jamaican alto player so vital to the British jazz scene from 1951 till his death in 1973. Hardback.
Joe Lovano & Dave Douglas,Sound Prints,Greenleaf,"The post bop masters with pianist Lawrence Fields, bassist Linda May Han Oh, and drummer Joey Baron. Two Shorter classics — Fee Fi Fo Fum and Juju — in amongst their originals."
Joe McPhee,Nation Time (Plus),Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘The music on Nation Time came out of a fertile, but little-known creative jazz scene in Poughkeepsie, New York, McPhee’s home base. Two bands were deployed, one with a funky free foundation featuring guitar and organ, the other consisting of a more standard jazz formation, with two drummers and the brilliant Mike Kull at the piano. Across the concert and the next afternoon’s audience-less recording session, the band was ignited by McPhee’s passion and his gorgeous post-Coltrane / post-Pharoah tenor. On Shakey Jake, they hit a James Brown groove filtered through Archie Shepp, while the sidelong title track is as searching and poignant today as it was during its heyday. Originally released in 1971 on CjR, an imprint started expressly to document McPhee’s work; reissued here with three newly discovered tracks, including a heartstopping version of Coltrane’s Naima.’"

Joe McPhee,As Serious As Your Life,Hat Hut,"The founding principle of this magnificent Swiss label was to document the music of Joe McPhee. Here he is solo, more than two decades later in 1998, on reeds, pocket cornet, piano and electronics, nodding to Trane, Marilyn Crispell, Miles, Conlon Noncarrow, Ra, Gershwin… and Val Wilmer. It’s gripping, direct and evocative; brimming with body and soul; very warmly recommended."
Joe McPhee,Cosmic Love,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"Invigorating shots of spiritual jazz — the business, no sugar, no additives — in two versions from 1970, for tenor saxophone and space organ. Lovely artwork by Dick Higgins.
Fab."

Joe McPhee,Alone Together,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘Multi-track, multi-instrumental recordings — more compositional in nature than Sound On Sound — especially prized by the man himself. Over-dubbing builds and sculpts each piece, creating complete wind ensembles one track at a time. In 1974 and then again in a longer session in 1979, McPhee recorded himself in concise solo, duo, and tripartite self-communion, like a one-man-WSQ, his probing investigations and lyrical statements as incisive and insightful as those of his best-known recordings.’"
Joe McPhee,Barrow Street Blues,Holidays Records,NA
Joe McPhee,The Willisau Concert,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘In absolute top form on tenor and soprano saxophones, ranging from the relaxed and confident Afro-conscious feel of Nation Time to areas of more diffuse and textural investigation. John Snyder’s analog synthesizer is brilliant and hyperbolic, a surprisingly hand-in-glove match for McPhee. South African drummer Makaya Ntshoko is the surprise element, a guest whose sensitivity and warmth are everywhere evident, even when he kicks the energy up a notch. Along with McPhee originals, this reissue includes a never-released bonus, their take on the classic God Bless the Child, a total heartbreaker.’"
Joe McPhee,From Outer Space,Roaratorio,"With James Keepnews on guitar and laptop; David Berger on drums.

Vinyl only, no digital. 500 copies, that’s it."
"Joe McPhee, Andre Jaume",Nuclear Family,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘A studio recording from 1979, previously unreleased. It is primarily structured around pairs of tunes by Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, and Duke Ellington (or Billy Strayhorn), adding Ornette Coleman’s Lonely Woman for good measure. The results are stunningly intimate and show the twosome’s capacity for creative interplay at a fairly early stage in its unfolding. Pithecanthropus Erectus gets pared down to its essential walking-bass-ness, while Monk’s Evidence is taken apart, and solo spots by both men are as riveting as one would expect.’"
"Joe McPhee, Mats Gustafsson",Brace For Impact,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘As searching and searing as anything either of them has made, these 2008 duets live up to their explosive title. Gustafsson is known for his energy, and it’s here in droves, but there are other nuances brought out by McPhee — a supple sense of melodicism (hey now, Gustafsson is a Swede, so by birthright he’s melodic) and the love of experimental sound-making that McPhee displayed on his sound-on-sound recordings in the late ‘60s…
‘Insanely powerful. We recommend that you prepare yourself for the impact.’"

John Tchicai With Strings,,Treader,"Spiritual jazz — frank, deep, reaching; no fakery.
Tchicai appears on Ascension and Ayler’s New York Eye And Ear Control; he’s on Witchdoctor’s Son, with Johnny Dyani and Dudu Pukwana, besides landmark recordings with Archie Shepp, including Four For Trane; and his Mohawk LP on Fontana is a five-star affair. Yet still Richard Williams in The Guardian reckoned this ‘wise and lyrical’ album ‘one of his best recordings’.
Here his playing is somewhere new, oscillating between Dolphy and Konitz. John Coxon and Ashley Wales are rivetingly attuned to him, on harpsichord, trumpet, electric guitar, sampling, bowls and percussion. In different ways the music evokes such talismanic recordings as Ayler’s set Swing Low Sweet Spiritual, Jimmy Giuffre’s live performance of Jesus Maria, Trane’s Dear Lord, and George Russell’s Electronic Sonata For Souls Loved By Nature.
Originally issued as a CD by Treader in 2005. This first vinyl release is hotly recommended."
Johnny Griffin,The Congregation,Dol,NA
Johnny Hammond,Gears,BGP,"This Mizell Brothers production from 1975 is surely their masterwork. No hanging about on the grid — the sublime opener Tell Me What To Do flies like a Byrd; followed by the bonafide Loft classic Los Conquistadores Chocolates, a psychedelic, heads-down floor-filler which hit big at Ron Hardy’s Chicago Music Box as well as in NYC. Fantasy was a Paradise Garage staple; and Shifting Gears is here, too — a seriously funky breaks and block party anthem, heavily sampled by classic hip hop. It’s a must… not least in the form of this 40th anniversary LP edition, with six previously unissued tracks — five tasty new numbers and a skeletal version of ‘Can’t We Smile?’"
Johnny Hammond,Black Coffee,Riverside,NA
Johnny Hammond,Gambler's Life,Salvation,"His first, apostate recordings with the Mizell brothers. A kind of stepping stone between the Kudu set Higher Ground — tasteful but fusty, a few months earlier — and the classic Gears LP to follow next year. The new sound is all there in the title track, rollicking and street-wise, straining at the leash; Fender Rhodes, not Hammond B-3. 
(From 1974, the third of the five LPs on Salvation (twixt Airto and the New York Jazz Quartet), which Creed Taylor set up as a CTI-offshoot, originally for gospel, then quickly re-cast for stuff he didn’t produce himself.)"

Johnny Mbizo Dyani,"African Bass, Solo Concert",Sing A Song Fighter,"Lifeblood of the cultural diaspora of Apartheid, Dyani left South Africa with the Blue Notes in 1964. His amazing discography includes crucial collaborations with Don Cherry, Steve Lacy, Dollar Brand, the Brotherhood Of Breath and Derek Bailey. 
Here he is performing solo at a jazz festival in Switzerland in 1978, testing the compositions which would comprise his monumental LP African Bass, out two years later. 
Double bass, gongs, piano and singing. Knockabout, mystical roots — spell-binding and ecstatic, open-hearted and unafraid.

There is funk, bebop, vintage electronica and improv; John Surman, Dexter Gordon, Steve Kuhn; interpretations of Maiden Voyage, Joni Mitchell and Bobbie Gentry; selections from her 1968 LP masterwork, Joy, with Jan Garbarek; and two previously unreleased recordings. The closer reworks a movement from A Love Supreme. “It was John who pointed to the text on the inner sleeve of the Impulse! LP,” she recalls. “Karin, look. Why don’t you sing this?”"

‘The Armenian duduk that anchors the project is a double-reeded woodwind instrument made of apricot wood with thousands of years of history. Traditionally its music is played in duet: a melody on one duduk; a low drone accompaniment, the dum, on another. Kolida Babo preserves and extends the dual nature of duduk music in many ways, replacing the dum at times with the tones of a Moog synthesizer to allow the two players to weave harmonies together in duet.’

Try Louis’ opening duet with Velma Middleton, an extravagantly affirmative New Orleans blues about sex, sexual attraction, sexual exploitation, sexual violence and death. A massive, rumbling groove, with choice male-female banter, and extended soloing, sent from heaven.
The 1954 LP plus alternates and rehearsals, corresponding recordings with Bessie Smith from thirty years earlier, and a live version of the opener, with Leonard Bernstein. Smoking band — Barney Bigard, Trummy Young, Billy Kyle, Arvell Shaw and Barrett Deems.

This edition adds all known alternate takes, and seven spare Oliver-related tunes recorded by Armstrong in the mid-fifties.
Frankly, if you can listen to this almighty killer version of St James Infirmary without holding onto something, that might as well be you on the slab (so cold, so sweet, so fair)."

The Lyman Woodard Organization,Saturday Night Special,Strata,"Moody, sometimes acidic, improvisatory jazz funk from Detroit, where Woodard — on electric keyboards — had been playing down the years with Dennis Coffey, Undisputed Truth and 8th Day. Recorded in 1973."
Jimmy Lyons,Push Pull,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"Cecil Taylor’s stalwart collaborator, in the best of his recordings as leader; recorded in 1978 and originally issued by Hat Hut as a 3-LP box set. ‘Five extended pieces, all by Lyons, with a working quintet: Lyons himself on alto, his wife Karen Borca on bassoon, Hayes Burnett on bass, Munner Bernard Fennell on cello, and Roger Blank on drums. Jolting, quicksilver free jazz with terse themes and brilliant interplay, the music is quintessential Lyons  — searching, pliant and sincere. Remastered from the original tapes, this first reissue of Push Pull restores the original tracks — two of which were split into LP sides — to their true continuous length.’"
Maciej Obara Quartet,Unloved,ECM,NA
Makaya McCraven,In The Moment,International Anthem Recording Co.,"Nineteen, hip-hoppin, be-boppin capsules of funk, conjured and distilled from a year’s worth of weekly shows by the drummer, in a reclaimed bank vault in the heart of Chicago’s Ukrainian Village. 
Jazz improvisation — but compact, to-the-point and organic as a mosquiter’s tweeter — dipped in krautrock, d&b, house and B-boy science. Featuring the brilliant vibes playing of Justefan, and local luminaries like Jeff Parker from Tortoise and De’Sean Jones from Underground Resistance.
Warmly recommended."
Makaya McCraven,Highly Rare,International Anthem Recording Co.,"Taking the same approach as In The Moment — which smashed it here at the shop —  submitting live recordings by his quartet (drums, bass, alto saxophone, cornet) to his own sustained, detailed post-production techniques of editing and re-arranging, looping and layering."
Makaya McCraven,Universal Beings,International Anthem Recording Co.,NA
Makaya McCraven,Where We Come From,International Anthem Recording Co.,"Recent collaborations in London with Nubya Garcia, Joe Armon-Jones, Soweto Kinch, Ashley Henry, Daniel Casimir and Kamaal Williams… remixed live the next weekend by LeFtO, Ben LaMar Gay, Quiet Dawn, Earl Jeffers & Don Leisure of the Darkhouse Family, and later by Emma-Jean Thackray and Lexus Blondin… finally chopped-up and re-assembled back at Makaya’s home studio in Chicago, into two continuous side-long suites."
Maki Asakawa,,Honest Jon's Records,"A stunning survey of the 1970s heyday of this great Japanese singer and countercultural icon.
Deep-indigo, dead-of-night enka, folk and blues, inhaling Billie Holiday and Nina Simone down to the bone. 
A traditional waltz abuts Nico-style incantation; defamiliarised versions of Oscar Brown Jr and Bessie Smith collide with big-band experiments alongside Shuji Terayama; a sitar-led psychedelic wig-out runs into a killer excursion in modal, spiritual jazz. 
Existentialism and noir, mystery and allure, hurt and hauteur.
With excellent notes by Alan Cummings and the fabulous photographs of Hitoshi Jin Tamura.
Hotly recommended."
Mankunku Quartet,Yakhal' Inkomo,Jazzman,NA
Herbie Mann,Muscle Shoals Nitty Gritty,Warners Japan,"Ace jazz-soul blends, down-home and funky. Check the tasty Jew’s harp on Sonny Sharrocks’s Blind Willy, and the joo-joo-eyeballed, monkey-fingered version of Come Together.
Amazing line-up… with Roy Ayers, Miroslav Vitous and — from FAME — Eddie Hinton, Barry Beckett, David Hood and Roger Hawkins."

Maria Monti,Il Bestiario,Holidays,"A magical record by this Italian actor in films by the likes of Bertolucci and Leone, with Alvin Curran, Steve Lacy and Roberto Laneri from Prima Materia amongst her co-conspirators in its dream-like menagerie of styles and textures, setting poems by Aldo Braibanti (who’d been banged up for a much more grievous kind of ‘psychological kidnapping’ just a few years earlier). Enchanting stuff, beautifully presented by Holidays in Milan, including a pamphlet of the lyrics, with English translations. Originally released in 1974 by RI-FI."
Mark Murphy,Midnight Mood,MPS,"One of the great jazz vocal albums.
The NY hipster in Cologne for the day in 1967, with eight members of the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland big band, including Sahib Shihab and Ronnie Scott. Kicking off with Murphy unaccompanied in Duke’s Jump For Joy, the performances are masterful throughout, in wonderful repertoire, with a perfectly measured, enthralling introspectiveness.
Sconsolato in particular is ravishing, sublime Latin jazz, with casually brilliant drumming by Kenny Clarke and a gorgeous muted trumpet solo by Jimmy Deuchar, from Warrington. A desert island disc.
Very warmly recommended."
Mark Murphy,A Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn,Gearbox,"A no-frills, loving tribute — with Shirley’s longtime drummer Steve Williams and double bassist Curtis Lundy (brother of Carmen), formerly of Betty Carter’s group; also the fine pianist Alex Minasian and trumpeter Till Brönner."
Mark Turner & Ethan Iverson,Temporary Kings,ECM,NA

Esther Marrow,"Newport News, Virginia",BGP,NA
Warne Marsh,Ne Plus Ultra,Hat Hut,"Superb improvising by the Cool School alumnus, taking a line for a walk in all directions, before magically bringing it home. Gary Foster’s alto is uncannily attuned to Marsh, and the rhythm section swings. Including two canonical Tristanos and a Konitz — and some OG Bach to close, a bit tongue-in-cheek, with tantalising brevity. Recorded in 1969 for the Revelation label."
Sabu Martinez,Burned Sugar,Mellotronen,"Ultra heavy jazzy funk recorded for Swedish National Radio in 1973, but never before released. With Polish heavyweight Wlodek Gulgowski on keyboards."

Masayuki Takayanagi New Direction Unit,April Is The Cruellest Month,Blank Forms,"‘Masayuki “Jojo” Takayanagi (1932 - 1991) was a maverick Japanese guitarist, a revolutionary spirit whose oeuvre embodied the radical political movements of late ‘60s Japan. Having cut his teeth as an accomplished Lennie Tristano disciple playing cool jazz in the late ‘50s, Takayanagi had his mind blown by the Chicago Transit Authority’s “free form guitar” in 1969 and promptly turned his back on the jazz scene by which he was beloved. Takayanagi had found a new direction, an annihilation of jazz and its associated idolatry of hegemonic American culture. Aiming his virtuoso chops towards the stratosphere, Takayanagi dedicated himself to the art of the freakout, laying waste to tradition left and right, most notably via the all-out assault of his aptly-named New Direction For The Arts (later, New Direction Unit) and collaborations with like-minded outsider saxophonist Kaoru Abe. His innovations on the instrument parallel those of Sonny Sharrock and Derek Bailey and paved the way for the Japanese necromancy of Keiji Haino and Otomo Yoshihide.’
This is the classic lineup, with Kenji Mori (alto sax, flute, bass clarinet), Nobuyoshi Ino (bass, cello) and Hiroshi Yamazaki (percussion), in 1975 recording sessions originally slated for release on ESP, before it went down later that year."

Mathias Eick,Ravensburg,ECM,"Evocative, engaging considerations of close relationships, a bit like a family portrait, centred on the German town of Ravensburg (home of the trumpeter’s grandmother), by a sextet including affective violin and two drummers, involving African percussion, homemade cymbals and bundles of brushwood, with ‘driving rhythm at the bottom end and soaring melody at the top.’"
"Jean-Louis Matinier, Marco Ambrosini",Inventio,ECM,"Alluring duets by Swedish nickelharpa and accordion, inspired by Bach’s sonatas and Pergolesi. (You might recall Matinier from sessions with Anouar Brahem and Louis Sclavis.)"

Maurice Louca,Elephantine,Sub Rosa,NA
Max Cilla,La Flute Des Mornes,Bongo Joe,"Sublime music from Martinique — free-flowing, mystical roots, with lilting jazz, Latin and Cuban rhythms.
Cilla dedicated himself to the revival of the bamboo flute ‘of the coastal hills’, which he fashioned by hand from a single piece of wood, according to ancient Indian traditions. In this recording from 1981 — a kind of Antillean sister-star to Don Cherry’s Mu albums — it is featured alongside the traditional percussion instruments of Martinique.
Warmly recommended. Good for souls."

Les McCann,Invitation To Openness,Omnivore,"His best record, from 1972 — spaced-out, funky, East-Of-The-River-Nile jazz, in the swell of Bitches Brew. 
The Lovers builds, grooves, stretches and subsides, over twenty-six minutes — with some terrific oboe and flute from Yusef Lateef, especially late on, and characteristically soulful electric piano throughout by LM. Bernard Purdie nails down the left channel, Alphonse Mouzon the right. Fabulous stuff.
This issue adds a fresh live version of Compared To What, full throttle, with Buddy Guy. ‘Where’s that bee and where’s that honey? Where’s my God and where’s my money?’"

"Mengelberg, Brötzmann, Parker, the Benninks, Rutherford, Bailey",Groupcomposing,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘This was the sixth production on Mengelberg and Bennink’s ICP label. It’s largely absent from the history books because the record has been so unavailable, certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. 
‘Moving from peaks of intensity to droning de-escalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, Groupcomposing should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann’s Machine Gun and Nipples, the early London Jazz Composer’s Orchestra and Globe Unity Orchestra, and Manfred Schoof’s European Echoes.’"
Mette Henriette,,ECM,"‘The young Norwegian interlacing form and freedom in fresh ways here, as her intense and focused tenor saxophone sound moves inside three-dozen compositions of sometimes disarming fragility. Vulnerability can be as potent as full-tilt blowing; there is a place for both. The expressive and emotional range is wide. Disc one features trio music with Mette Henriette, pianist Johan Lindvall and cellist Katrine Schiøtt; disc two, Mette’s ‘sinfonietta’, with thirteen players.’"

Milford Graves,Babi,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘The long-awaited first reissue of one of the most legendary albums in the history of free music. Recorded live in concert in 1976, when Graves’ trio with saxophonists Arthur Doyle and Hugh Glover was at the height of its powers, Bäbi is a testament to the absolutely unique approach the drummer had established for himself. He had reconfigured the drum kit, removing the second heads on all the drums and replacing the snare with two toms, which allowed him a much more nuanced sense of indirectness in his multi-directional adventures in time. The track Ba remains one of the most astonishing feats of percussion alchemy ever waxed, as funky as ten slap bassists and as free as an exploding grenade. Doyle and Glover are incendiary, too, inspired by Graves to new and shocking heights of achievement, their hoarse cries and whistling split-tones carried to thrilling plateaus on the energy of Graves’ hands and feet.
‘In 2017, Graves discovered a previously unknown tape in his archives featuring the same trio at its inception, in home recordings made seven years earlier in 1969. Graves pummels a huge gong while Glover plays an instrument that, after sounding like none ever known, turns out to be bass clarinet. Extreme music recorded up close and very hot, it is among the most searing sessions never heard. Until now.’"

Charles Mingus,Oh Yeah,Atlantic,"Thrillingly uncontainable, uproarious, wildly creative music, teeming with passion, protest, sex, orality, dread, blues and the gospel truth. With Roland Kirk newly enrolled, Mingus passes his bass to Watkins… and it all kicks off. We can’t recommend this record strongly enough. It will do you good.
180g vinyl from DOL."
Charles Mingus,The Clown,Atlantic,"‘I am trying to play the truth of what I am. The reason it’s difficult is because I’m changing all the time.’ From 1957, hard on the heels of Pithecanthropus Erectus — hotter fire, and another masterpiece, featuring killer soloing from CM. On Haitian Fight Song: ‘I can’t play it right unless I’m thinking about prejudice and persecution, and how unfair is it. There’s sadness and cries in it, but also determination. And it usually ends with my feeling ‘I told them! I hope somebody heard me!’’ Reincarnation Of A Lovebird is here, too."
Charles Mingus,Pithecanthropus Erectus,Atlantic,"Downright crucial, game-changing Mingus — with Jackie McLean, J.R. Montrose, Mal Waldron and Willie Jones in 1956. The tone-poem title track is an emotionally intense, thrilling presentiment of jazz to come; experimental but fun, A Foggy Day runs the standard into a riot of street sounds; Profile Of Jackie is wistful and hurting, the more expressive for its reining in McLean; Love Chant is a foot-tapping Mingus jam, modal and extended, with enjoyable soloing all round.

Monty Alexander,Here Comes The Sun,MPS,"Of this Jamaican pianist’s whole heap of recordings — running all the way back to Clue J and the Blues Blasters, at Studio One — here is one of our clear favourites: a quartet date (including Montego Joe on congas) in 1972, kicking off with a scintillating go at Richard Evans’ Montevideo, copped off Ahmad Jamal, and featuring an unmissable, funked-up commandeering of the title track.
Announcing an overdue reissue series of MPS LPs — expertly produced, with outstanding sound."

Morton Feldman,Clarinet And String Quartet,Saltern,"Clarinet, two violins, a viola and a cello. ‘A gorgeous new recording — made in the living room of a friend of the musicians — highlighting Feldman’s interest in notation by treating slight differences in intonation and rhythm literally and specifically. It begins with the clarinet and the cello repeating B-A-C-H backwards (B-natural, C, A, B-flat) in minutely different rhythms and phrasings, announcing the pitch-world of Feldman’s late music, in which chromatic clusters (often four notes) are obsessively restated in different permutations, like anagrams.’"

Nate Morgan,Journey Into Nigritia,Outernational Sounds,"How many sixteen-year-olds would have the confidence to walk up to a revered bandleader, and inform him that one day they’d be playing together? This is how pianist Nate Morgan introduced himself to the founder of the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra. The teenager had heard Tapscott’s Flying Dutchman LP The Giant Is Awakened on the radio, and Arthur Blythe’s wailing sax had gone ‘straight to the heart. It was a spiritual experience.’ He was already studying with Joe Sample and Hampton Hawes; now Morgan showed up to all the Arkestra shows he could.
‘I could only take about two or three more concerts before I had to run up on stage. When I first introduced myself to Horace, he tells everybody that I said, “Yeah, I’m Nate Morgan. I’m going to play with you all.” Not that I want to, but that I’m going to.’
Over the next decade and beyond, Morgan would become a central figure in Tapscott’s UGMAA (Union Of God’s Musicians and Artists Ascension’), bringing new players like Jesse Sharps into the fold. During the early 1970s he also put in a stint with Rufus and Chaka Khan, and played on Willie Hutch’s Foxy Brown soundtrack. He remained active throughout the 1980s and 1990s, keeping the UGMAA flame alive in late night jams and private sessions, and working tirelessly around LA, including collaborations with Bone Thugs N’ Harmony. He was a participant in the early 2000s LA jazz collective Build An Ark. A true musician’s musician, Morgan died in 2013.
Originally released in 1983, this was the first of Morgan’s two LPs for Nimbus. Also featuring firebreathing reedsman Dadisi Komolafe, it’s a committed, spiritualised work that showcases Morgan’s heavy composing as well as his McCoy Tyner- influenced and technically flawless playing, with dedications to Coltrane (He Left Us A Song) and Cecil Taylor (Study In C.T.). 
Surging, modal jazz from the LA undergound, Journey Into Nigritia is a crucial recording by an unsung jazz legend."
Nathan Davis,"Suite For Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",Tomorrow International,"A moving, lovely, heartfelt tribute, seamlessly combining jazz-funk, soul, gospel, Black Jazz, bebop, Latin, spoken word and co, with palpably higher concerns than genre and market.

Ndikho Xaba And The Natives,,Matsuli,"Ndikho Xaba was born in 1934 in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, South Africa: for thirty-four years —  1964 –1998 — he lived in exile in the US, Canada and Tanzania. Originally issued by Trilyte Records out of Oakland, California, this 1970 recording is bracing, freewheeling Now Thing, suffused with SA idioms, and focussed by a political urgency wiring together US Black Power, Black Aesthetics and the anti-apartheid front-line like nothing else. You can hear Trane from the off — ‘a spiritual offering to my ancestors’  — and plenty of Sun Ra, with whom The Natives several times shared double-bills. Freedom is a gutbucket-soul rendition of the people’s anthem; that’s Plunky from the Oneness Of Juju playing saxophone on Nomusa; the thunderous finale features drummer Keita from the West Indies, and Baba Duru, who studied percussion in India, before winding up with Xaba blowing eerily through a horn made from a giant piece of tubular seaweed."

"Okay Temiz, Johnny Dyani",Witchdoctor's Son,Matsuli,"The visionary Turkish percussionist and the great South African bassist were introduced by Don Cherry in 1969, when Dyani moved to Sweden after the break-up of The Blue Notes. They worked together regularly over the next decade, starting out with Cherry in the Eternal Ethnic Music trio. 
“Another world,” recalls Temiz. “At that time I was trying to learn as a big band jazz drummer, and when I met Don Cherry, I said, forget it. We played another kind of music. Indian music, Turkish music, Bulgarian, Chinese, you know… All kinds of music.” “Every musician,” Dyani said later, “should realize and acknowledge that folk music is the backbone of every music.”
Recorded in Istanbul in 1976; originally released in an edition of one thousand copies only, on the Turkish label Yonca. The first side features Turkish material arranged by Temiz; the second, SA-oriented music put together by Dyani, opening with a stunning interpretation of Cherry’s Marimba (Goddess Of Music)."

Pacific Express,Black Fire,Matsuli,"Militant jazz, fusion, funk and soul from mid-seventies Manenberg, outside Cape Town, with a set of roots in club dance traditions like ballroom (‘langarm’), Khoisan hop-step and the whirling ‘tickey draai’ (‘spin on a sixpence’) of the mine camps; others in jazz-rock and the New Thing."
Alfred Panou & The Art Ensemble Of Chicago ,Je Suis Un Sauvage,Souffle Continu,"A stunning complement to Theme De Yoyo!
Panou was an activist and actor, in Paris from Benin; he plays a refuse collector in Jean-Luc Godard’s Weekend. His texts here cross existentialism and Black Power like a knockabout Richard Wright, with an extra shot of anti-colonialism. Recorded by Pierre Barouh for Saravah, in the same months as its classic Comme A La Radio LP with Brigitte Fontaine, furthering the AEC’s rowdily brilliant elaborations of Leroy Jones’ Black Dada Nihilismus.

Sounds From The Village is even better (and dirtier), showcasing Ranelin’s oily trombone gymnastics and a viciously fuzzed guitar solo… The obligatory Coltrane tribute He The One We All Knew is the kind of groove-based free-playing typical of Pharoah Sanders, though only really picks up when the band launch into post bop swing mode in the last six minutes or so… Beautiful stuff… Essential.’"

Sun Ra,Continuation,Saturn,"Late-sixties… with Marshall Allen on Jupiterian flute and Danny Thompson on Neptunian libflecto. ‘Great slow blues, creepy space voice, very cool space-exotica, crazed circus fanfare and a cacophonous romp.’ 
CD from Corbett vs Dempsey."
Sun Ra,Other Planes Of There,Evidence,"This 1964 experiment is minimal, precise and — even by Ra’s standards — very unusual. Featuring a fabulous tirade from tenor John Gilmore on the title track."

Sun Ra,The Futuristic Sounds Of Sun Ra,Poppy Disc,"‘Space jazz reverie’ for septet, recorded by Tom Wilson for Savoy in 1961. Ra on piano; great tunes. New Day is classic Arkestra — bass, cymbals, hand percussion, Gilmore’s bass clarinet. Picture disc."

Sun Ra,"Monorails & Satellites: Works for Solo Piano Vols. 1, 2, 3",Cosmic Myth,"The two Saturns, from 1966; plus a third, previously-unreleased volume of five originals and four standards. 
‘More of a collection of statements than a style. Some of the tunes, with their odd juxtapositions of mood, could be mistaken for silent film scores. Perhaps they were audio notebooks, a way to generate ideas which could be developed with the band. Regardless, they serve as compelling standalone works. The fingering reflects Sun Ra’s encyclopedic knowledge of piano history as his passages veer from stride to swing, from barrelhouse to post-bop, from march to Cecil Taylor-esque free flights, with a bit of soothing candelabra- swank thrown in. Sunny’s attack is mercurial, his themes unpredictable. His hands can be primitive or playful, then abruptly turn sensitive and elegant. As with the whole of Sun Ra’s recorded legacy, you get everything but consistency and predictability. 
‘The listener also experiences something rare in the omniverse of Sun Ra recordings: intimacy. His albums, generally populated by the rotating Arkestral cast, are raucous affairs. With the Monorails sessions, we eavesdrop on private moments: the artist, alone with his piano.’"

Randy Weston,Little Niles,Pure Pleasure,"Radiant bop — inspired by RW’s children, Niles and Pam — recorded in 1958, with presentiments of his signature African and Caribbean inflections. ‘All in three-quarter time, these charming little vignettes escape rigidity of beat by a fluid flow of counter-rhythms and melodies, one against another, that brings continuous delight,’ according to Langston Hughes’ sleeve-notes. With Johnny Griffin and trumpeter Ray Copeland from the Monk set-up; the great, under-sung Melba Liston; and George Joyner and Charlie Persip on bass and drums."

Roger Glenn,Reachin',BGP,"Stone-classic Latin fusion album, produced by Larry Mizell. The boom track in the day was Rio — a galloping jazz samba — but there is plenty of pure Mizells brilliance, and Paul Jackson and Bill Summers layer in the Headhunters. Don’t miss the Afro-Cuban drum chant, to close."
Roland Young,Isophonic Boogie Woogie,EM,"An Afro-Steve Reich-style kalimba. Then come electric bass clarinet, soprano sax, bells, chimes and electronics. Sparse, spaced and meditative — this is highly recommended."
Sonny Rollins,,Blue Note,"His first for Blue Note as a leader, at the end of 1956, after an amazing string of releases for Prestige. The opener is killer — a masterfully tentative, funky blues, with Wynton Kelly soloing one note at a time, then Max Roach on brushes only; and Rollins unburdening with typical fluency. Donald Byrd is in town, too, from Detroit."
Sonny Rollins,Volume 2,Blue Note,"What a band! Jay Jay Johnson, Art Blakey, Paul Chambers… and Horace Silver and Monk sharing piano duties, with both of them playing on the ten-minute version of Misterioso."
Sonny Rollins,A Night At The Village Vanguard,Blue Note,"Tremendous live recordings, without piano, triumphantly foregrounding the gripping physicality, wit and headlong inventiveness of Rollins’ playing. 
Spotted by Max Roach, Pete La Roca gets his first big break, still in his teens, stepping in for Elvin Jones on A Night In Tunisia.
An undisputed jazz classic."
Sonny Rollins,With The Modern Jazz Quartet,Prestige,"Early singles under Sonny Rollins’ name. Actually just the first four cuts involve the MJQ, with Rollins and Milt Jackson sparking brilliantly off each other. Their rendition of In A Sentimental Mood is gorgeous. Then that’s Miles Davis playing piano on his own composition I Know, together with Roy Haynes and Percy Heath, in Rollins’ first quartet, in 1951. There’s also a rug-cutting version of Shadrack, but Satch and co wrote the book."

Eddie Russ,Take A Look At Yourself,Soul Brother,"His second, 1978 LP for the Nashville-based Monument label, again produced by Bob Crawford. Highlights include the percussive title track, featuring Eddie’s keys and Jackie Holiday’s soulful singing, a fine version of Don’t Ask My Neighbours, and a rare-groove styling of Quincy’s I Heard That.

Warmly recommended."
Abdullah Sami,Peace Of Time,Spiritmuse,"Burning underground jazz recorded in 1977 in New York (but blowing in from Chicago), and originally self-released in a tiny run, in homemade sleeves.

Eleven exuberantly swinging, startlingly fresh jazz ragas by an ensemble combining hard-core Bombay jazz messengers, Bollywood royalty, and sitar master Ustad Rais Khan.
This is indo-jazz fusion direct from the source: an extremely rare glimpse of the same Bombay jazz scene that gave us Amancio D’Silva. Nothing kitsch here: by turns rollicking and lyrical, this is edgily committed and heartfelt music-making. 
Never reissued since its 1968 release by EMI India, Raga Jazz Style is a collectors’ holy grail of Indian jazz; and this is a highly impressive inaugural salvo by Outernational Sounds, using original masters and beautifully rendered facsimile artwork, with 180g vinyl pressed at Pallas, in Germany.

Nina Simone,Nina At The Village Gate,Essential Jazz Classics,"Sinner Man is here. Backed by a trio of guitar, bass and drums; with six bonus tracks, including all other known recordings from the same 1961 engagement, and (with orchestra) two studio counterparts."

Sounds Of Liberation,,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘Hailing from the Germantown section of Philadelphia, the same neighbourhood as the Sun Ra Arkestra communal homestead, Sounds of Liberation were at the forefront of ‘70s Black liberation music. After a series of gigs in elementary schools, prisons, and community centers, in 1973 the band travelled along with their manager George Gilmore (whose son was in Breakwater) to a recording session at Columbia University, NYC. This five-song session has never been heard until now.’
It’s a buzzing, grooving, radiant blend of Latin, funk, soul and free jazz, by a septet featuring Khan Jamal, Byard Lancaster and Monette Sudler. An unidentified group of singers throws in a spiritual take on the Temptations, to close triumphantly.
With art by LeRoy Butler, who also worked for Ra at this time.

Spontaneous Music Ensemble,Oliv & Familie,Emanem,"The third SME LP, originally out on Marmalade, plus 31 minutes previously unissued. Oliv I is Kenny Wheeler and Derek Bailey soloing over a four-person voice and saxophone drone, eventually joined by a piano/bass/drums rhythm section. II is John Stevens, Maggie Nicols, Trevor Watts and Johnny Dyani — one of the great early examples of the free improvisation era, and the recording debut of Nicols. Familie is by an eleven piece group — including Norma Winstone — strongly influenced by Gagaku (Japanese court music)."
Spontaneous Music Ensemble,Withdrawal,Emanem,"John Stevens, Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Barry Guy, Kenny Wheeler, Trevor Watts and Paul Rutherford.
The first half of this CD is recordings intended to be the soundtrack of a film about drug addiction, in two parts, plus their re-working, made in September 1966; the second (adding Bailey) a new suite by Stevens, recorded six months later.
In the words of All Music Guide: ‘Sometimes, unearthed documents can leave you cold, even though the intellect appreciates the historical gap being filled. With Withdrawal, history doesn¹t matter. This is gold, pure artistic beauty. Actually the whole CD contains fantastic free music, almost completely detached from jazz, very atmospheric, delicate, and highly organic with a strong sense of discovery. Historical significance notwithstanding, simply a great album, still very relevant and ‘new’ today.’"
Spring Heel Jack and Wadada Leo Smith,Hackney Road,Treader,"Brand new recordings by the electronic duo together with the great AACM trumpeter; joined by drummer Steve Noble and keyboardist Pat Thomas.

Staffan Harde,,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘Based on the tiny Swedish fishing island of Smogen, guitarist Staffan Harde created a wholly unique and wondrous approach to his instrument. This lone, extremely rare LP from 1972 features him solo and with small groups. His accomplices include pianist Lars Sjösten, bassist Lars-Urban Helje, and the acclaimed percussionist Bengt Berger, one of Don Cherry’s close associates. With a direct tone and low action, Harde’s slinky, spidery runs and gnarled chords retain a surprising freshness, with heavy chromaticism and a defiant rhythmic freedom.’

Steve Lacy,Morning Joy,Hat Hut,"From 1986: half Lacy’s stuff — including Wickets — half Monk’s, including a great In Walked Bud. Oliver Johnson and Jean-Jacques Avenal make a superb rhythm section, pulsating, bristling, always moving on; Steve Potts squalls and testifies like a post-Trane trooper; Lacy is a livewire, darting and alight. Don’t potter off before before the finale, As Usual: it’s triumphant."

Sun Ra,The Intergalactic Thing,Roaratorio,"‘Anyone who saw the Arkestra perform will remember the band quickly shuffling through an imposingly thick stack of sheet music, when Sunny would call the next tune with an encrypted hint on his keyboard. Band members might spend long hours practising a new composition, never to play it again. Here, we have a taste of the hidden: drawn from rehearsals at the Sun Ra house in Philadelphia from 1969, The Intergalactic Thing introduces a dozen never-before-heard pieces from Ra’s songbook, along with a handful of reworkings of such Ra classics as Spontaneous Simplicity and The Exotic Forest. Without a doubt, one of the most important augmentations of the Sun Ra catalogue in many a moon. In a beautiful gatefold jacket, including extensive liner notes by Ra discographer Robert L. Campbell, and a download coupon.’"
Sun Ra,Discipline 27-II,Saturn,"Another unmissable Ra LP — previously impossible to find — from the same 1972 sessions as Space Is the Place. The opener Pan Afro is a modal tear-up bossed by Gilmore’s saxophone; the title track is a hugely enjoyable, side-long, Ra-led space chant."
Sun Ra,3rd September 1988 Chicago,Klondike,"‘One thing is certain about a Sun Ra performance: You never know what to expect.

Still fresh from two solo albums for Paul Bley’s Improvising Artists label, Ra leads the way on piano and synthesiser, alongside drummer Luqman Ali, from the Arkestra’s early years in Chicago, and vocalist Thomas Thaddeus (still around two years later, for Lanquidity).

Clark Terry,Swahili,Phono,"Mumbles, taking a break from Ellingtonia for his first recording session as leader, in 1955. Killer band, including Horace Silver, Oscar Pettiford and Art Blakey; swinging arrangements by Quincy Jones. The title track is absolute first-degree murder. Don’t miss it."
Clark Terry,In Orbit,Riverside,With Monk.
Clark Terry,Clark Terry And His Orchestra Featuring Paul Gonsalves,Sam Records,"Recorded for Decca France during Duke Ellington’s 1959 tour of Europe, in the final month of the trumpeter’s almost eight-year tenure with the band. 
‘Terry was one of the most gifted trumpeters to grace the Ellington band and he blossoms when he has more opportunities to solo in a small group setting like this one. Gonsalves proves to be the perfect foil for Terry as they trade lines on several of the numbers. Unlike many dates led by Ellington veterans, this one doesn’t rely heavily on songs from the vast Ellington songbook, including only Satin Doll. Also a Monk tune, a Babs Gonzales, and three of Terry’s compositions, best of all Serenade To A Bus Seat (revisiting his upbeat instrumental reflections on the hectic life of a touring musician).’"
The Albert Mangelsdorff Quintet In Asia,Now Jazz Ramwong,Tiger Bay,"This wonderful 1964 recording was born of the group’s recent tour from Turkey to Japan. Fifty shows in ten weeks: Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Vietnam… You can tell straightaway how bamboozled, thrilled and inspired everyone was by what they heard back, in these warm, open blends of jazz — head-nodding modal to free, bluesy to sunlit, with Trane and Mingus loud and clear — and outernational folk, especially Asian. 
A decent pressing, in a handsome gatefold sleeve, with excellent notes by Joachim Berendt. Duly licensed.
Fabulous music; highly recommended."
The Best Of Inner City Records,,BBE,"Spotlighting the Jazz Dance side of the US jazz label, founded by Irv Kratka and Eric Kriss in 1976, and in the DNA of projects like BBE, HJ and Soul Jazz. With a stand-out quota of proper songs… old friend after old friend."

The Descendants Of Mike And Phoebe,A Spirit Speaks,Strata-East,"Spike Lee’s dad Bill leading three other family members and percussionists Sonny Brown and Billy Higgins, in 1973. Stone classic spiritual jazz, majestic but intimate, with touches of gospel, soul and classical music. Invoking ancestors in slavery; protesting Attica; celebrating Weldon Irvine. An unmissable version of Bill Lee’s composition Coltrane (the jewel in the crown of Clifford Jordan’s mighty Glass Bead Games, the same year).
This is the superior edition supervised by Pure Pleasure, with expert re-mastering from the original tapes, and 180g vinyl pressed at Pallas."

Tete Mbambisa and co, chasing the mbaqanga in Trane. Five originals and Love For Sale, from Johannesburg, 1969.
‘Both urban Africans and urban Americans were consciously crafting ‘modern’ music – and in South Africa’s case, it was a modernism deliberately and defiantly set in opposition to the narrow, backwards-looking parochialism of apartheid, where some white universities did not even permit gender-mixed dancing until the 1970s. The sophisticated, snappily-dressed black players of South Africa’s cities in the 1960s were not trying to ‘be like’ America; rather, they were enacting in their performance, and reaching through their horns for what a new South Africa might sound like.’
180g vinyl with excellent sound; photographs from the Ian Bruce Huntley archive and concert bills; extended notes.

Henry Threadgill,"In For A Penny, In For A Pound",PI,"An epic in four main movements, featuring each member of Zooid: Elliott Kavee on drums and percussion, Christopher Hoffman on cello, Jose Davila on trombone and tuba, Liberty Ellman on guitar; with HT’s alto, flute and bass flute woven throughout. ‘A great Threadgill solo sets you on edge: you know that it‘s going to be a jab, an uppercut or a body blow, but you never know how or when it‘s going to hit you. Likewise the music here: it comes at you from every angle, at different speeds, in infinite combinations. That‘s the beauty of Threadgill‘s music for Zooid: that sense of constant surprise.’"
Henry Threadgill,Dirt... And More Dirt,PI,"With fifteen musicians — guitar, bass, drums (2), cello, tuba, alto saxophone (3), flute (2), trumpet (2), trombone (2), and piano (2).
‘The works are part of Threadgill’s ongoing exploration for integrating composition with group improvisation, in particular an entirely new system of improvisation based on preconceived series of intervals. They bear the unmistakable stamp of all Threadgill compositions: complex forms, multi- layered counterpoint, rigorous polyphony, and timbral contrasts all wrapped up in a swirl of rhythmic convolution. The use of multiple horns and woodwinds on Dirt… vastly expands the music’s harmonic and tonal palette at Threadgill’s disposal, adding a much wider range of color, texture, and weight.’"
Henry Threadgill,"Double Up, Plays Double Up Plus",PI,"‘The New York Times called Threadgill a ‘composer and bandleader of intense, unyielding originality, nobody’s idea of a compromise.’ An early member of the AACM, he still believes in finding one’s individual path through original music. Here he builds on all of his prior work to create two magisterial works of great power and beauty. Together, they represent the crowning achievements in his still-flourishing half-century long career.
‘On board are holdovers Davila (tuba), Hoffman (cello), Filiu (alto saxophone, alto flute), Macdonald (alto saxophone) and Weinrib (drums, percussion) — but the interaction between three pianists lie at the heart of this piece, performing an intricate contrapuntal dance of varying attack, register, and density.’"

Downright unmissable for the secret-weapon version of Shorter’s all-time-classic Tom Thumb, and the first recording of Carter’s lovely, sinuous Little Waltz. Great record."
Bobby Timmons,Soul Food,Prestige,NA
Cal Tjader,Solar Heat,Modern Harmonic,"With a great band, including Ray Barretto, João Donato, Bobby Rodriguez and (doubling up on vibraphone) Gary McFarland. An easy-swinging 1968 blend of jazz, Latin and exotica, with tasty pointers to seventies funk like the breaks-rich title track. Other highlights include a moody Ode To Billy Joe, Donato’s Amazon, and — best of all — Fried Bananas.

Tom Prehn,Axiom,Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘Arguably the rarest LP of European free jazz, recorded in 1963 for the Danish label Sonet, but not fully released. Impossibly uncommon, exceptionally wonderful music, featuring an extended tenor saxophone solo by Frits Krogh, influenced by Sonny Rollins, but strikingly his own man. The rhythm section is deep into non-metrical time, and comparisons to Cecil Taylor are valid, though Prehn’s playing favours chords and clusters over linear runs. For the CD, the two tracks of the original LP, mastered from both extant copies of the test master, are augmented by a single track from 1966, never before released.’"

There are tributes to Stevie — ‘master of the blues’ — and Ursula Le Guin. ‘It needs to be personal, meaningful, otherwise the blues can be banal. I believe it to be sacred, like a spiritual discipline.’"

Tyshawn Sorey,Alloy,PI,"This slipped in under the radar, just before Christmas. It’s a dazzling, soul-searching brew of deconstructed but highly lyrical piano-trio balladry, free improv, minimalism — critics will mention Morton Feldman in relation to anything at the drop of a hat — and Impressionists like Mompou, Faure… even startling shots of brilliant funk, in Template. Hotly recommended."

Tyshawn Sorey,Verisimilitude,PI,"Back with bassist Chris Tordini and pianist Corey Smythe (adding a little toy piano and electronics), following up the trio’s Alloy set from 2014. Positioning him between Milford Graves and Milton Feldman, the New York Times calls it ‘Mr. Sorey’s latest and best album… bereft of almost anything resembling a steady cadence. Instead, what’s inside the pulse — resonance, fluid, potential — comes to the fore.’ ‘It’s not rare for recordings of improvised music to give a sense of the physical space between instrumentalists, but with Mr. Sorey’s trio, that air seems to be in a state of charged collapse, packed with magnetic density.’"

He played with The Fugs, Allen Ginsberg and Annette Peacock; more recently, William Parker and Badal Roy. He set up the Uni Trio during his military service in Panama. ‘at night we would go to the banks of the canal with palm trees and the stars and the universe around us. that’s why we called ourselves the UNI Trio, becouse we were playing universal music, playing out with stars and the universe.’ Here he is with Randy Kaye and Ornette’s bassist David Izenzon in 1968."

Vijay Iyer & Wadada Leo Smith,A Cosmic Rhythm With Each Stroke,ECM,"‘Heartbreaking clarity and economy of expression… to the accompaniment of pianist Iyer’s wistful melodic fragments and pregnant clusters. Smith can project a tender fragility through a single lingering note, reminiscent of Miles at his most thoughtful and noirish circa Ascenseur Pour L’Echafaud’ (The Wire)."
"Vijay Iyer, Craig Taborn",The Transitory Poems,ECM,NA
Wadada Leo Smith,"Red Chrysanthemums, Solos 1977",Corbett Vs Dempsey,"‘Three adventurous, spacious displays of Smith’s unique and innovative trumpet — besides percussion, tuned percussion and flute — right at the crest of his induction into the pantheon of AACM greats. A candid snapshot of one of the most vital musicians to extend the jazz tradition, testing his craft and artistry with a bright, pure-toned sensibility and deeply soulful melodic imagination.’"
Wadada Leo Smith,America's National Parks,Cuneiform,"Expansively evocative and richly thought-provoking, wonderful music-making by the great trumpeter, leading Anthony Davis on piano, bassist John Lindberg, Ashley Waters on cello and Pheeroan akLaff, drums.
‘My focus is on the spiritual dimensions of the idea of setting aside reserves for common property of the American citizens: those who have passed on before, those who are here in the present, and those who will come in the future.’

Guy Warren,Afro-Jazz,Return To Analog,"Guy Warren came through as a percussionist for ET Mensah’s Tempos, in 1940s Accra. Moving to London, he joined Kenny Graham’s Afro-Cubists in 1950; he deejayed for the BBC. In 1956 Warren released his first LP — Africa Speaks, America Answers — whilst relaying between the jazz milieux of New York and Chicago.
“He was so far ahead of what we were all doing that none of us understood what he was saying,” reckoned Max Roach. “He knew that in order for Afro-American music to be stronger, it must cross-fertilise with its African origins.”
Afro-Jazz is Warren’s most sought-after record. Startlingly, he fronts the Ian Carr/Don Rendell Group at the apex of their stay at Lansdowne Studios, in 1969. Warren, Carr, Rendell, Tomkins, Green, D’Silva, Garrick; produced by Denis Preston.

Welcoming back vocalist Leena Conquest, Flower is dedicated to Martin Luther King, and the affirmation of social and political justice and equality for all human beings. With trombonist Steve Swell, saxophonists Dave Sewelson, Abraham Mennen and Nick Lyons, South African drummer Kesivan Naidoo (in his first work with Parker), and the bassist’s son Isaiah on piano.

Mary Lou Williams,Mary Lou Williams,Folkways,"Finally a legitimate reissue, which does full justice to this wonderful music. 
‘Described by Duke Ellington as being ‘beyond category’, Williams was conversant in jazz styles ranging from stride through swing and be-bop to the avant-garde, yet her music was always rooted in spirituals and the blues. This self-produced recording, originally recorded in 1962 and 1963, contains a mix of standards and originals including four original compositions reflecting her devout interest in religious music.’
Presented the gloriously old-school Folkways way, with the cover on a card wrapped halfway around the back of a textured, black house-sleeve — featuring David Stone Martin’s sublime cover art, beautifully reproduced — and a booklet.
Hotly recommended."

Workshop De Lyon,La Chasse De Shirah Sharibad,Souffle Continu,"With the arrival of clarinettist-saxophonist Louis Sclavis in 1973 (and the departure of trumpeter Jean Mereu in 1975), the Workshop De Lyon was born of the Free Jazz Workshop.
A warmly accessible, beautifully performed, joyous mixture of wailing improv and propulsive, rootical preparations, this second album derives its upful, digressive theatricality from the Arts Ensemble Of Chicago, and its urgent sublimification of vernacular rhythms and melodies from Albert Ayler. Wild and free, but grounded in stuff like Bechet, Monk and George Russell. 
Terrific."
Workshop De Lyon,Tiens! Les Bourgeons Eclatent...,Souffle Continu,"The collective methodology of the Workshop de Lyon led to the creation in 1977 of the ARFI (Association Researching An Imaginary Folklore). Inspired by the AACM, its mission was to ‘encourage improvisation, spread diverse musical styles and provide means of expression to others with similar ideas, nurture folklore…’ 
This third Workshop LP was released in 1978 on the ARFI label. Pianist Patrick Vollat had left, so this is a quartet: Louis Sclavis, Maurice Merle, Jean Bolcato and Christian Rollet.
Sclavis fruitily to the fore, it’s the most rhythmic, low-down, silly-voiced and best fun of these three LP reissues — amongst the crown jewels of French free jazz — expertly produced as per by Souffle Continu. 
Nuts, howling-at-the-moon version of Nobody Knows You When You Are Down And Out has a touch of the Clangers."
Savina Yannatou,Songs Of Thessaloniki,ECM,"The singer’s fourth ECM is an intrepid, dazzling, Balkan convocation of ghosts — Greeks, Jews, Turks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Armenians, Slavo-Macedonians, Pontiac Greeks — even including an Irish song about the city. With expert playing by homeboys Primavera en Salonico — qanun, accordion, oud, guitar, violin, nay, double bass, percussion."

Abranis,Chenar Le Blues,Bongo Joe,"The legendary kabyle rockers, founded in 1967, courageously pioneering a fusion of chaabi with hippie, disco and other musical styles, shuffling such diverse influences as Elvis, James Brown, The Doors and Johnny Halliday in amongst Slimane Azem, Taleb Rabah and Saadaoui Salah.

Accident Du Travail,Tres Precieux Sang,The Trilogy Tapes,"Eight charged, intimate meditations by Julie Normal and Olivier Demeaux, playing a rickety ondes Martenot and an old church harmonium.
Gripping, detailed, stately improvisation — a bit like the ùrlars in classical bagpipe music — which nervily mixes the sternly doom-laden with precarious, other-worldly wonderment. 
(The ondes Martenot is an amazing twentieth-century instrument — beloved by Messiaen, for example, and Varese. The theme-song of Star Trek is a vocal forgery of its sound. ‘J’aime cette fragilité qui côtoie la capacité de te décoller le tympan sur certaines fréquences inopinément,’ says Julie. ‘Je tiens une bombe dans les mains. J’aime son instabilité, son humanité.’) 
Wood, breath, blood, eggshells… on the night of a purple moon. 
Very warmly recommended."
Larry Achiampong,Untitled,Look Mama!,"Powerfully strange, melancholic, Londoner meditations about the roots, routes and after-lives of the West African diaspora. Rollicking recordings at the Christ Reformed Church in Peckham are combined with LA’s own sombre, throbbing, oscillating synth-work. Moodier and deeper than his precious Mogya albums, but extending their troubled consideration of cultural legacy. Like them, self-released in a short run, soon gone — so don’t hang about."

Relaxed grooves, easy-listening swing, a little Latin, dreamily sublime vocals, tinges of folk music from around the world… a full-colour palette of mind-expanding sounds, threaded by a spoken narration and Ahbez’s wood flute.

‘One of the most straightforwardly engrossing pieces Basinski has ever put on record… made using ancient synthesizer technology and not tape loops, it feels like the slabs of sound have been placed on top of each other with the aim of producing specific bodily effects — not the vague promise of comfort and well-being that you get in New Age music, but a compromised kind of bliss laced with fear. It’s a version of the sort of anonymous ‘wallpaper’ music Eno always wanted to make, but it’s so richly detailed and so conflicted that it feels less like staring at wallpaper and more like charting all the cracked bits of beautiful plasterwork in a collapsing house.’ (Tiny Mix Tapes)."

Birds Of Venezuela,,Sub Rosa,"Beautiful recordings by the French ornithologist Jean Roche; introduced by David Toop.
‘The bird songs which i had recorded in the West Indies in 1969 made me inclined to find out more about those of the nearby South American continent, and convinced me, moreover, that musically speaking, they possessed an unquestionable originality in comparison with those of Africa and Europa. I therefore decided to carry out a series of orthinological trips on this continent, starting with the North… I disembarked at Caracas on 27th May 1972. The unusual musical volume of this tropical country made its impact on my arrival in town, where the unbearably shrill chirping of the cicadas overwhelmed me each time I passed under a tree. At night fall, around even the meanest of ditches filled by the daily rain, myriads of toads and frogs struck up a concert, which, through its sheer intensity, muffled all other surrounding noises. When I penetrated the forest, I could hear bird species literally by the dozen and individuals by the hundred, all calling and singing together at dawn and at dusk.’"

‘For well-tuned just-intonation Fender Rhodes and sine wave drone, Mode Nouvelle Des Modalités is a probing meditation with shades of Paul Bley. Equal Temperament is performed on the same keyboard in twelve-tone equal-temperament tuning, with a tape delay system recalling Terry Riley, but more sombre and hallucinatory. Album centrepiece The Well-Tuned Marimba is an undulating marvel of lysergic drone, using well-tuned Yamaha, sheng, sine wave, and live electronics, evoking The Electric Harpsichord — a later Hennix masterwork — with marimba in place of harpsichord stops.’"

Synths, voice, glass and metal chimes, plastic tubes and other simple, often primitive instruments lyrically interpellate field recordings of wind, high-tension wires and waves crashing onto a beach. Inspired by the work of Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Charlemagne Palestine and Simone Forti, Curran suggestively destabilises the listener’s senses of place, being and time, in side-long forays."

Twenty-six fragments of electronica by the Krautrock mystic, like stepping stones between the phase of music-making which culminated in Aum the previous year, and his imminent departure for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh’s ashram in Poona, home to key-works like Celebration, Haleakala, Ecstasy and Silence Is The Answer."

DSR Lines,Spoel,Black Sweat,"Ace. Check it out.
‘David Edren’s organic, minimal electronics are never majestic or magniloquent (like Schulze or Froese); never neurotic or aggressive. It is a soft music, delineating echoes of sacred geometry in the emotional balance between oscillations, frequency modulations, and rhythmic pulsations. Diamonds, mineral combinations, emerald luminescences, hydrogen cascades and the stratospheric colouration of Jupiter and Saturn… 
Spoel is the description in miniature of the macrobiotic life of ‘unfolding planets’; more interior than exterior. A micro-tonal ensemble of blood streams, cells, strings of muscle and air passages, in the visionary tradition of Micheal Hoenig, J.D.Emmanuel and Tonto’s Expanding Head Band.’

Ellen Arkbro,Chords,Subtext,"“I listen to these chords with an interest in them as complete events in themselves and without any particular attention to their sequential occurrence. To me, chords with a high degree of harmonic clarity display diamond-like qualities. There is a sense of geometric complexity to the experience — both in very concrete terms, with regards to the ways in which these chords merge with acoustic space, but also on a more subtle level, on which harmony almost feels like space, and where the manifold ways of hearing these sounds spontaneously translates into modes of spatial awareness.”"
Ellen Fullman,The Long String Instrument,Superior Viaduct,"Her debut LP, from 1985.
The opener features droning, seventy-feet-long metallic wires, anchored by a wooden resonator, vibrated by the rosined fingers of Fullman and Arnold Dreyblatt: massive and enchanting — like standing inside a gigantic grand piano — with organ-like overtones and otherworldly textures. 
Other tracks bring to life the Drip Drum, constructed from water falling into an amplified aluminum pan, manipulated by foot pedal."

Franco Battiato,Fetus,Superior Viaduct,"‘Sometimes Battiato gets likened to Brian Eno,’ writes Simon Reynolds. ‘A better analogy might be with Brazil’s Tom Zé or France’s Serge Gainsbourg… The mixture in Battiato’s music — especially evident in these early albums — of playful mischief and questing passion is captivating.’  
Originally released in 1971 on Bla Bla, Fetus explores themes of genetic engineering. Primordial, VCS3-synthesizer soundscapes shift between dream and delirium. FB’s unsentimental, yet evocative voice — twinned with infectious melodies and sublimely detached lyrics — is featured in haunting sound collages the length of pop songs, with ties to Pink Floyd’s Meddle, Os Mutantes and Jim O’Rourke."
Franco Battiato,Clic,Superior Viaduct,"‘Moving further out for his fourth LP, in 1974, via pure and elemental approaches to sound, flowing organically from one musical form to the next. Rippling with orbital chords, kosmische textures and schizophrenic string quartets, yet managing the same dramatic pacing and variety as his avant-rock albums Fetus and Pollution.
‘The LP’s dedication to Stockhausen comes into focus on the closing scramble through Italian shortwave radio, cut with bits of outernational folk music from around the world (whipped from a 1950s Henry Cowell compilation for Folkways). It’s the perfect ending to Battiato’s beautiful and expansive tour of the cosmos, announcing the uncompromising experimentalism that would dominate his work in this period.’"

German Oak,Down In The Bunker,Now Again,"The definitive reissue of this milestone album of Krautrock, by turns fetishized and demonized for nearly four decades. Plus a second disc of both rare and previously unreleased music.
 In the booklet guitarist Wolfgang Czaika blames manager and organist Manfred Uhr for the band’s sustained nodding to Nazism, in the past; and titles like Swastika Rising are subbed here (along with the Hitler samples). Still, for The Quietus, these ‘nightmarish proto-industrial space jams’ remain ‘noxious and creepy enough’ on their own account; but still ‘unearthly and ahead of their time’. For example, ‘the nineteen-minute Missile Song, which cycles through clanging metallic percussion, ultra-sparse crypto-jazz drumming, a bass sound beamed in from a deep bath next door, outbreaks of haphazard haunted house onomatopoeia by unnamed instruments. It’s a bit Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun, early Faust, Sun Ra even, but sonically stunning for three rudderless rock trippers who basically just tossed this onto tape with no real thought about what might become of it.’"

Allen Ginsberg,The Last Word On The First Blues,Omnivore,"The classic session plus eleven previously unissued performances, featuring contributions from Bob Dylan, Happy Traum, Don Cherry, Peter Orlovsky, Arthur Russell and co, in a luxuriously turned out 28-page colour booklet with rare photos and new essay by the producer Pat Thomas.
John Hammond was chuffed by the original release of The First Blues in 1983: ‘I recorded Allen in 1976 but Columbia Records refused to issue the results, considering the songs obscene and disrespectful. I am thrilled to finally be able to present Allen… I will present ‘disrespectful’ music like this as often as possible.’"

Giovanni Di Domenico & Jim O'Rourke,Arco,Die Schachtel,"‘Nothing short of a masterpiece!... Sustained tones and drones, vividly immersive, almost physical… The subtly shifting tones, the way the overtones interact with each other, the evolution of the piece, are all impeccable, much in the vein of acclaimed composers like Catherine Christer Hennix, Eliane Radigue and David Behrman, although with a ‘warmer’ soul.’"
Gokcen Kaynatan,,Finders Keepers,"Driving teenagers wild with his custom guitars, Kaynatan’s electrification of Turkish rock’n'roll at the turn of the 1950s was a keystone in the foundations of Anatolian rock. As in-house electronic composer of the country’s first national television channel, his influence flows through fifty years of Turkish pop culture (notwithstanding a discography of just four 7” singles to his name). 
Here is the first-ever collection of GK’s pioneering electronic works. Running back to 1968, it features both highly-sought-after 1 Numara singles — including the first issue of an extended version of Evren — as well as previously unheard TRT 1 material."
Golden Retriever,Light Cones,Root Strata,NA
Golden Retriever,Seer,Thrill Jockey,"Luminous, emotionally charged, free but focussed duets by Matt Carlson (modular synthesizer) and Jonathan Sielaff (bass clarinet), weaving together German strands from Edgar Froese through Manuel Gottsching, and threads from a line of US experimental electronic composers including Alvin Curran, Maryanne Amacher and David Behrman. 
Gripping, intimate, complex, out-there… Warmly recommended."

Alain Goraguer,La Planete Sauvage,Superior Viaduct,"1973 soundtrack beloved by Dilla, Madlib, Air and co. The orchestral, expansive ether recalls AG’s sixties projects with Serge Gainsbourg, but teleported to a psychedelic, space-age world of its own, mapped out in a series of vignettes — moody, baroque, wasted, hypnotic, out-there… with funky wah-wah guitars, flutes, Fender Rhodes, breaks-n-beats drumming and effects."
Greatest Hits,Danse Pop,Olde English Spelling Bee,"Brilliant, dazed and skewiff electro-pop from Fact magazine’s label of the year. The Autre Ne Veut is pretty great, too."
Grimm Grimm,Kazega Fuitara Sayonara,Pickpocket,"Entrancing debut release on a label run by Charlotte Marionneau from Le Volume Courbe and My Bloody Valentine’s Kevin Shields. Minimal, hook-strewn space-folk by Koichi Yamanoha — from cult psych-punks Screaming Tea Party, with contributions from LVC, members of Chrome Hoof, and fellow Japanese ex-pats Bo Ningen — mixing together the harsh, melancholic beauty of Nico, Green World ambience, the tunefulness of classic pop, and the otherworldliness of Joe Meek. Lovely stuff."

Harry Partch,Bitter Music,Bridge,"‘A diary of eight months spent in transient shelters and camps, hobo jungles, basement rooms, and on the open road’. A collage of readings and musical fragments, this long-lost journal of HP’s wanderings during the Great Depression (from cleaning sewers to tea with W. B. Yeats) is ‘an extraordinary musical portrait of an American pioneer, chronicling his occasionally hilarious and often heartbreaking struggles to forge a new music system outside the classical tradition.’"

Harry Partch,And On The Seventh Day Petals Fell In Petaluma,New World Records,"Thirty-four verses of expanded duets, the prototype of Delusion Of The Fury, thrashed out with the Gate 5 Ensemble over a three year period starting late in 1962, in a too-small space within an abandoned chick hatchery in Petaluma, California.
Plus a section of a rehearsal session, with HP himself giving direction, ending with a fine performance by Danlee Mitchell and Michael Ranta.

Heldon,Un Reve Sans Consequence Speciale,Souffle Continu,"The fifth album, from 1976, originally out on Cobra.
‘Intense, violent, bitter, abrasive, uncompromising prefigurations of Industrial and post-rock. It is easy to understand why Merzbow, Wolf Eyes and Oren Ambarchi all wanted to collaborate. Whilst run-of-the-mill comparisons between Heldon/Pinhas and King Crimson/Fripp are hitherto sustainable, Un Rêve Sans Conséquence Spéciale explosively busts open new ground.’"
Heldon,Interface,Souffle Continu,"After Un Reve, second of the trilogy of LPs recorded at studios Davout during the heyday of punk: ‘a guided tour through the ruins of a civilisation’; and an evilous, innovative prophesy of electro, industrial, post-rock and noise."
Heldon,Stand By,Souffle Continu,"Pinhas with Patrick Gauthier, François Auger and Didier Batard, from 1979; whilst Klaus Blasquiz’ vocal spot adumbrates the links between Heldon and Magma, and runs back to his time with Pinhas in Blues Convention. 
The knockout here is Boléro, twenty minutes of sound and fury, lit up by the sequencers of engineer Didier Badez."
Helen,The Original Faces,Kranky,"‘Very lovely indeed,’ it says in Uncut. ‘For half an hour, fragile pop melodies are drenched in an enveloping haze of guitar fuzz, Liz Harris’ vocals shaped by a heavy reverb aura.’ 
‘Harris’ low moan is an exquisite performance, her fingers reaching around your heart to exert powerful emotional pressure,’ attests The Wire."
Henning Christiansen,Den Rode Skov,Penultimate Press,"The previously-unissued soundtrack to Ursula Christiansen’s second film, The Red Forest, made in 1986. One of the wildest recordings in the entire Henning Christiansen catalogue, this is a rich tapestry of sounds and voices, drifting elusively from the meditative to the hysterical. Delirious and demonic; at once highly ​e​ccentric and utterly enthralling."
Henning Christiansen,The Executioner,Penultimate Press,"Exquisite, melancholic, vocal-based works drawing the listener deep within the tension and despair of the feminist themes of Ursula Reuter Christiansen’s first film, in 1971. 
Previously unissued."
Henning Christiansen,Hesteofringen,Holidays,"Horse Sacrifice was performed on Danish TV in 1970, as a protest against the Vietnam War.
It hinges on a haunting, fragile song entitled My Dead Horse, with Lene Adler Pedersen accompanied by Bjørn Nørgaard on piano, and HC on violin. This beautiful, sad lullaby is as simple, precious and unusual as anything in Christiansen’s output. Previously unreleased."

J.D. Emmanuel,Echoes From Ancient Caves,Black Sweat,"Ravishing jazz and electronics from the same stumbling, giddy reaches as La Monte Young and Terry Riley, recorded in Texas in 1981 on multi-tracked organ and synths (with tape loops of birds and wind-chimes), and acoustic guitar.
‘My music is designed to enhance deep meditative, or altered states, to allow the listener to personally connect to the Creator of All that exists in the Universe. My music style is to first create a foundation using cyclic, polyrhythmic music, then build several layers of improvised leads and rhythms that allows you to transcend time and space… We have Memories of Past Lives that reverberate in our hearts like Echoes From Ancient Caves.’"

Released in 1981, during the last years of the military dictatorship in Brazil, her own Estorias unfolds wonderful, shimmering, utopian counter-witness. Weaving together voice and prepared piano, violin, percussion, synthesizers and electric celesta; rooted in Brazilian music but notably influenced by Indian raga and Japanese Shomyo singing; inspired in part by the sounds of immigrant communities within her hometown of Sao Paulo: this is a masterwork of electro-acoustic music, as always beautifully presented by Blume."

Julius Eastman,The Nigger Series,Blume,"As Mary Jane Leach puts it, in her sleevenotes: ‘Julius Eastman wrote what can be categorized as minimal music, but also ‘post-minimal’ music before minimal music was fully established. His pieces straddle the two main styles of minimal music — rhythmic/pulse driven music (Steve Reich and Philip Glass) and spectral drone music (La Monte Young and Phill Niblock). While using process and rhythmic patterns, there is a flexibility that lends a breathing, organic feel to his music, a muscularity missing in a lot of other music from that time.’"
Julius Eastman,"Evil Nigger, Gay Guerrilla",Blume,"‘Evil Nigger runs at a breakneck pace. The sheer density begins to drown out the percussive nature of the instrument. Eastman then manipulates these swarming clusters into extended tones that serve the piece’s melodic development. Finally, he strips the density away, leaving nothing but a few knotty notes punctuating several minutes of silence.’ 
With a burgeoning militancy, and a sexual suggestiveness to its layered sameness and symmetry, and a shift from white piano keys to black, ‘Gay Guerrilla starts with a serenely shimmering gallop that inevitably flows out in a deep, sprawling river, replete with a liberal quote from the Lutheran hymn, A Mighty Fortress Is Our Lord’, by way of Bach (Matt Wellins, in Dusted)."
Julius Eastman,Crazy Nigger,Blume,"A big break for Julius Eastman was his lead part in the 1973 Nonesuch recording of Peter Maxwell Davies’ Eight Songs For A Mad King (funded by Ken Russell). A couple of years later, under the general guidance of Morton Feldman at SUNY Buffalo, his production of John Cage’s Songbooks was queerly risqué; and Cage was furious, pontificating at a lecture the following day that Eastman’s “ego… is closed in on homosexuality. And we know this because he has no other idea to express.” Promptly departing academia, Eastman reprised Eight Songs with Boulez at Lincoln Center. He was the favourite bass singer of Meredith Monk and Hans Werner Henze. He started a jazz combo with his brother Gerry, guitarist with the Count Basie Orchestra. Most famously he was a close collaborator of Arthur Russell, singing and playing keyboards for Dinosaur L. That’s him loud and clear on Go Bang."

Kassel Jaeger,Le Lisse Et Le Strié,Latency,"A new work by François J. Bonnet — the director of INA GRM — deconstructing the binarity ‘smooth’/‘striated’. ‘If ‘smooth’ is linked to ‘nomos’, within an open space of organic distribution, then ‘striated’ is associated with ‘logos’, as a kind of gridded enclosure. An interplay is mapped out, whereby pulsations become textures and layers, and where rhythmic elements are teased from the qualities and densities of sounds, rather than deployed as pre-determined sound objects in their own right, abstracted and frozen onto a temporal grid. ‘Striation’ is made audible only through the sonic landscape it inhabits, in the same way that animal camouflage comes alive in the woods and long grass, becoming redundant and inert out in the open.’"

Kilchhofer Anklin,Moto Perpetuo,Marionette,"Electroacoustic exchanges between Benjamin Kilchhofer’s modular synth and the live drumming of Michael Anklin (from the Book Room sessions).
Inspired by the duo’s mountainous rural surroundings, where high plateaux abruptly give way to stony ravines and wooded trails, the recording embodies a fluid concept of time, with constantly shifting rhythmic pulses. The idea was to create an instrument in which musical contributions are interdependent (in the circular motion depicted on the cover), and the smallest disturbance might sway the entire system out of order. Its impossible prize is an ‘ur-klang’; a primordial, ancestral music.
Singular, immersive and intriguing. Check it out."

With his Nagra, Kirchin taped landscapes, people, places, machines, animals, birds, bees, the zoo, and autistic children in the valley of Schurmatt, Switzerland. These recordings were then slowed down — panned for their ‘little boulders of sound’ — and mesmerizingly layered, and marked for intervals of jazz improvisation by a sextet including Evan Parker and Derek Bailey.

Knud Viktor,Les Ephemeres,Institute for Danish Sound Archaeology,"The first time out for these amazing recordings, meticulously restored and presented by the Institut for Dansk Lydarkæologi. The 24-page booklet is richly illustrated by Viktor’s marvellous photography, besides extensive, absorbing notes.
‘After studying painting in Copenhagen, in 1961 Knud Viktor moved into some dilapidated 14th century limestone buildings on the slopes of the Luberon mountain in Provence in 1961. He describes being disrupted in his painting by the thousands of cicadae demanding his attention. “They settled on your body, on the walls of houses, everywhere. Cicadas everywhere.” Their sound mirrored the sunlight: when a cloud passed before the sun they would stop sounding or change their rhythm. Their sounds led him to experiment with field recordings. 
‘Often untreated and clearly recognizable, these recordings leave the inherent melody and rhythm of the animal sounds to sing for themselves, layering recordings to create simple and elegant sound images. In two of the twenty pieces Viktor’s own voice blends with the animals, as he recites two poems. One about the singing vineyard populated by musical crickets, the other painting an autumn picture with wine bubbling in the barrels as we hear the wine flies humming.’"

Komitas Vardapet,Six Dances,Makkum Records,"Wonderful recordings of Armenian piano music composed in 1906 — featuring imitations of the ‘dap’ tambourine, plucked tar, shiv reed-pipe and dhol drum — performed last year by Keiko Shichijo on a Steinweg Nachf piano, built in 1880.

La Contra Ola,Synth Wave And Post Punk From Spain 1980-86,Bongo Joe,"This is a blast — a tremendously entertaining survey, centred in the Basque country, uproariously mangling together everything from Suicide to dub, Surf to tribal-style chanting, Satanism to toothpaste, with zinging wit, energy and intelligence, and knockabout anti-authoritarianism. Well-presented; warmly recommended."

La Natura E L'Uomo,,Intervallo,"Alessandro Alessandroni, Franco Tamponi, Amedeo Tommasi, Kema and Marco Di Marco, in 1973; thematically following Biologia Marina and Ittiologia, and extending their amazing experimentalism (in tracks like Protozoi and Venus), but bringing sweeter, acoustic atmospheres into the mix."

Link Wray,3-Track Shack,Ace,"Three albums recorded on his brother’s farm in Accokeek, Maryland, in the early 70s. Quite different to his previous releases, the music remains raw and basic, but with vocals and acoustic guitars, mandolins, dobros and piano. ‘An organic blend of downhome music… imbued with a primitive spirituality. There is an unpolished, spontaneous feel to the music which sparks it greedily into life, and the Accokeek earth seems to be ground deep into every groove. You can even hear the frogs croaking outside the shack.’"

Mahjun,Mahjun (1974),Souffle Continu,"Their classic, influential, second Saravah, from 1974, joined by the great Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos. Leftist folk prog turned outernational psychedelic fusion. Try fourteen-minutes-long La Ville Pue."

A compendium of tiny homages to composers from Scarlatti to Stravinsky, and tributes to colleagues and influences, interspersed with heart-stopping Bach transcriptions. The wit and sublimity of these games, the incisiveness of the playing, four hands on the piano, and the affection between the elderly partners, are really  something to see. Off the beaten path for us, but hotly recommended."

Martina Lussi,Diffusion Is A Force,Latency,"The Lucerne-based sound artist with a sophomore set of droll, vigorous and richly stimulating reflections on themes like geopolitical and semantic fracture, the breakneck reconfiguration of communication (including how we listen to music), and the rapacious pervasiveness of the market-place, in all its absurdity and dread. Field recordings, processed instrumentation, synthesised elements, snatches of voice. Lots of guitar, in clean, pealing notes, or swampily distorted. Terrace chants blend into choral singing; the mechanical sounds of industry dredged from beds of drones and noise. "
Mary Jane Leach,Pipe Dreams,Blume,"The perfect introduction to the work of this key member of the 1970s New York minimalist scene, including Julius Eastman, Arthur Russell, Arnold Dreyblatt, Ellen Fullman and Peter Zummo. 
4BC is a drone for four bass clarinets, recorded during 1984; Pipe Dreams was written for the organ of St. Peter’s in Köln, with two sets of pipes at opposite ends of the church, each with their own microtonal sounds and stops. Terrific stuff."

Marshall McLuhan,The Medium Is The Massage,Five Day Weekend,"John Simon’s funny, entertaining chop-up of a mock MM debate, enacting subjectivities split and scattered, narratives disrupted, signification broken down… ‘Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey.’"
Mebusas,Blood Brothers,Academy,"It says ‘Volume 1’ on the cover, and this debut is full of promise, but it’s a one-off, from Nigeria, 1973: African styles grooving together with Latin and Caribbean, US soul and funk, and psych rock."

Ennio Morricone,Milano Odia: La Polizia Non Puo' Sparare,GDM Music,"Exemplary, neglected Ennio, composed in 1974 for Umberto Lenzi’s exceptionally violent cop procedural — a stone classic adrift in the vast Morricone oeuvre.
Brilliantly textured and atmospherically super-charged re-configurations of its core themes, threaded by propulsive 4/4 and bristling with signature motifs."
Ennio Morricone,Il Diavolo Nel Cervello,AMS,"For Sergio Sollima’s psychological drama, in 1971.
‘Piano, harpsichord, flutes and brass, grounded in strings. A very airy work with moments of tension, with the pace dictated by jazzy brush-work on the drums. Undoubtedly one of the Maestro’s best productions from the early seventies. With Bruno Nicolai conducting and a choral Edda Dell’Orso.’"
Ennio Morricone,Indagine Su Un Cittadino Al Di Sopra Di Ogni Sospetto,AMS,"Bare Morricone brilliance — vibraphone and out-of-tune piano, plucking and boinging — blending together tension, reflection and dream, for Elio Petri’s thriller Investigation Of A Citizen Above Suspicion."

Like Tecnologia, the next Intervallo/Rotary revive, Sandro Brugnolini aka Narassa’s entry shows the label at its most experimental; still fresh and forward-looking. 
‘Vacuum, Conflittuale and Filterband chip in some electro; and surely it was just a matter of time before Mobb Deep or someone copped the amazing Spleen. Don’t miss the liquid piano and synth mumbles of Subtone e Fantapolitica; and the prophetic glimpse of Stereolab in Aflogelia.’"

Nico,BBC Session 1971,Gearbox,"Briefly available on John Peel’s Strange Fruit in 1988, this four-track EP was recorded live for BBC Radio One’s Top Gear in February 1971. It’s Nico straight, no chaser. Four of her best songs; simply voice and Indian harmonium.
Knockout stuff  — ‘the kind of music that can be heard when there is a storm outside,’ she called it — like No One Is There and Janitor Of Lunacy. The first run-out for Secret Song, her sing-a-long about Saint Ursula’s cohort of eleven thousand virgins, beheaded by the Huns.
Fastidiously re-cut by Gearbox, on vintage equipment, from the master-tapes. With a download code."

Nicolas Jaar,Pomegranates,Mana,"A first physical release at last for this album inspired by Sergei Parajanov’s breathtaking Armenian masterpiece The Colour Of Pomegranates — even if some of the music was composed before Jaar watched it. 
Certainly he’d decided on his title even before coming across Parajanov. Already for Jaar a private emblem of change and upheaval, the fruit is broken open in the film: its juice seeps into a cloth, like blood, making the shape of ancient Armenia on a map. In hundreds of such moments of cultural and poetic saturation (including numerous different associations for the pomegranate), and in the film’s biographical, episodic form, Jaar found confluent ground for intimate, teeming musical reflections about his own life and Palestinian-Chilean heritage. “It gave me a structure to follow and themes to stick to. It gave clarity to this music that was made mostly out of and through chaos. It also gave me the balls to put it out.” "

O Yama O,,Mana,"Rie Nakajima and Keiko Yamamoto (co-founder of Cafe OTO in East London) are joined by violinist Billy Steiger and percussionist Marie Roux in a dozen deconstructions of Japanese folk music, for this pacy, intimately engaging debut album. 
Rie’s baby orchestra of rice bowls, toys, clock workings, balloons and motors is by turns haunted, teased, adorned and laid waste by Keiko’s chanting, rumbling, whispering and stamping on the floor. The production by David ‘Flying Lizards’ Cunningham deepens and spooks the mix, which sparks with energy and wit, grace and mystery."

It could be a spiked film noir soundtrack… and it’s also great because it sounds like a late night walk around Moscow (at least to us).”  
Terrific stuff, bedecked in knockout gatefold artwork by way of Will Bankhead."

Phantom Band,,Bureau B,"The album debut of the band formed by Jaki Liebezeit after Can, featuring his fabulous polyrhythmic drumming in a more reggaefied setting. Mixed by Connie Plank, with guest spots by Holger Czukay."
Phantom Band,Freedom Of Speech,Bureau B,"The second album of Liebezeit’s post-Can set-up — darker, more iconoclastic and out-rock this time, without a bass player, and featuring the laconic spoken-word of Sheldon Ancel."
Philippe Sarde,Les Choses De La Vie,Transversales Disques,"The warmly nostalgic, melancholic soundtrack of Clause Sautet’s film, from 1970. The orchestration is lushly romantic, with several lovely piano passages. No less than five goes at Stéphane Belmondo’s sublime, Chet-Bakeresque La Chanson d’Hélène."
Phill Niblock,"Niblock For Celli, Celli Plays Niblock",Superior Viaduct,"Coming after Nothin To Look At Just A Record, with its densely layered trombones, this is Niblock’s second, rarest LP, from 1984: a collaboration with Joseph Celli (who himself had worked with Cage, Oliveros and Ornette), playing oboe and English horn.
Niblock creates seamless, ringing drones by skilfully cutting all Celli’s breaths and pauses. Play it loud, he says, for its viscerality, and to get its ringing overtones rolling around your room."
Phillip Glass,"Music in Twelve Parts (Live in Paris, 1975)",Transversales Disques,"Newly discovered recordings of a concert in 1975 at La Maison De La Radio in Paris, by the sextet of Philip Glass, Jon Gibson, Dickie Landry, Michael Riesman, Joan La Barbara and Richard Peck.
Plus a 1974 interview with PG in his NYC loft during rehearsals, produced for French radio by Daniel Caux, co-founder of Shandar Records."
Pictures Of Sound,One Thousand Years Of Educed Audio: 980-1980,Dust To Digital,"Sumptuously presented, fastidious sound-conversions of everything from medieval music manuscripts to historic telegrams, seventeenth-century barrel organ programmes to eighteenth-century ‘notations’ of Shakespearean recitation."
Piero Piccioni,Bora Bora,AMS,NA
Piero Umiliani,La Ragazza Fuoristrada,Schema,"Moody Umiliani, with tasty Hammond and plenty of breaks. Set between Egypt and Ferrara, tackling racial integration in 1973, this is the second of Scattini’s films featuring Zeudi Araya. (That’s her singing on the spaced-out Cantata Per Miriam, over proto-Headz funk-drumming. Pretty great.)"

Piero Umiliani,Synthi Time,Schema,"Terrific Umiliani. Thrilling, boldly expressive experiments with synthesizers in 1971 — throwing in a little Hammond and spinnet organ — to set against artists like Moebius and Roedelius, coming through in Germany."
Piero Umiliani,Genti E Paesi Del Mondo,Black Sweat,NA
Pierre Bastien,Tinkle Twang 'n Tootle,Marionette,"Recordings of his wondrous sound sculptures — precariously bridging Jean Tinguely and Raymond Roussel — in which meccano marionettes play underwater trumpets and belt-driven fans flutter sheets of paper across the strings of a kundi harp. Lovely, magical stuff."
Pierre Marietan,Rose Des Vents,Mana,"An ‘action musicale’ crafted from materials gathered over six years by the Swiss composer and his team of sound engineers, acousticians and musicians — members of the Groupe d’Étude et Réalisation Musicale (GERM) he had founded in 1966 — in villages and towns scattered across France, starting in 1982.
The radiophonic voice of Ana de Carvalho poetically announces each scene: a vegetable market, interviews with villagers about their surroundings, braying animals, the hubbub of a train station. The intention is to enable ‘the possibility to ignore the sources to only listen to what the sound, in itself, is able to say, what is characteristic to its rapport with music.’ Various instrumentalists respond to these different sound-worlds.
Originally issued privately in 1987 in a run of 300, this limited edition is a terrific debut release by Mana, beautifully gatefold-sleeved, with a sixteen-page, risograph, A5 booklet, including a new text by Mariétan, and photos."

Steve Reich,"Four Organs, Phase Patterns",Superior Viaduct,"‘If it is the radical edge of uncompromising hardcore minimalism that you are after, this reissue of Four Organs and Phase Patterns delivers two key examples.
‘‘I am interested in perceptible processes’ Reich had written in 1968. ‘I want to be able to hear the processes happening throughout the sounding music.’ Four Organs is a radical realisation of this goal. Against the steady rattle of maracas, individual tones within a single chord are gradually lengthened. No changes of pitch or timbre occur, and the drawn out nature of the process provoked outrage at some early performances, when audiences found themselves caught up in a decelerating loop, being dragged towards stasis. Phase Patterns, composed a month later, relies on a phasing technique developed during Reich’s earlier experiments with magnetic tape recordings, which he allowed to drift out of sync. Identical figures initially in unison shift out of phase, generating unexpected patterns.’
‘Obviously music should put all within listening range into a state of ecstasy’ (Steve Reich).

Sam Kidel,Silicon Ear,Latency,"Following on from his musical dissection of call centres — Disruptive Muzak was Boomkat’s Record Of The Year 2016 — Kidel trains his evil eye on the gatekeepers of online communication.
The first side clamps an ear of its own to the perimeter of Google’s server-room in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The sonic qualities of the space are invoked via architectural plans based on photos of the interior. Trespassing the endless tangle of cables and humming servers, bouncing off the maximum-security walls, the music is the genie of these acoustics of space.
Half-sister to William Burroughs’ strategy of targeting certain buildings — like the London offices of the Church of Scientology — by playing them back recordings of themselves, Kidel calls his own procedure “mimetic hacking”, taking dual inspiration from the Anonymous mirroring of sites, in order to meddle with the original content, and also the grand tradition of warehouse parties run without the permission of the property-owners. 
The flip enacts a subversion of the global scourge of data-gathering and surveillance. An audio patch disables voice recognition software by triggering phonemes. The music is engendered by these cascading scraps of words."

Tony Conrad,Ten Years Alive On The Infinite Plain,Superior Viaduct,"A previously-unreleased recording of the first performance of what is perhaps the composer’s key work, connecting his revolutionary film-making with the experiments in long-duration sound of the Theatre Of Eternal Music. 
‘Ten Years began with image before sound, a row of quadruple projections arranged side-by-side, all the shuffling stripes cascading into each other. Over the next two hours the music throbbed and the projectors incrementally shifted inwards, their beams gradually uniting to form one pulsating, overlapping picture.’
For its 1972 premiere, Conrad played violin, and Rhys Chatham and Laurie Spiegel his hand-made instruments: the Long String Drone — a six-feet-long strip of wood with bass strings, electric pickup, tuning keys, tape, rubber band and metal hardware — and an arrhythmic bass pulse, throughout."

Travelling,Voici La Nuit Tombee,Souffle Continu,"‘A keyboard-based trio that probably represents best what Futura’s RED series was all about — jazz, rock and experimental inquisitiveness.

Twisted Tales From The Vinyl Wastelands,Volume 1,Trailer Park,"Tremendous compilation of skint ‘n’ shit-faced hillbilly boogie — ‘two minute dramas by nobodies long dead or worse,’ as it says in the notes.
Loads of songs about farm-track UFOs, with every special effect gimmick going — try Horace Heller’s high-as-a-kite opener, or Gene Hall’s rocking finale about the space race. (First to fuck on the moon.)
Killer after unnerving killer, though — from Neal Merritt’s drunkabilly I Like To Booze It, through Dan Price’s pervy nightmares and Forrest Green’s bottom-of-the-glass despair, to Little Carolyn Sue’s squeaky, sociopathic man-hating. 
Demented classics like Swamp Gas; anthems like Little Jimmy (going out to all dwarfs) and Poor White Trash.
Lovingly presented, with notes, original labels and brilliant artwork — even a short story.
Hotly recommended."

African Scream Contest,2,Analog Africa,"‘Right from the laceratingly raw guitar fanfare which kicks off Les Sympathics’ pile-driving opener, it’s clear that African Scream Contest II is going to be every bit as joyous a voyage of discovery as its predecessor. And just as you’re trying to get off the canvas after this one-punch knock out, an irresistible Afro-ska romp with a more than subliminal echo of the Batman theme puts you right back there. The Melody Aces’ Asaw Fofor would’ve been a killer instrumental but once you’ve factored in the improbably-rich-to-the-point-of-being-Nat-King-Cole-influenced lead vocal, it’s a total revelation.

Black Disco,Night Express,Matsuli,"Insurgently crossing Philly Soul, Cape Jazz and bump jive in 1976, the same year as the Soweto Uprising; poignantly shot through with Timmy Thomas’ Why Can’t We Live Together.
‘It was so important for us to play a kind of crossover then, to weave in touches of Motown, Philadelphia soul and Teddy Pendergrass that the coloured community appreciated, and Basil’s Cape Town sound, and Sipho’s sound that was legendary in the black community, and make music that people could all enjoy together… The regime divided us: people classified coloured had identity documents; black people had the dompas. We didn’t accept that separation. Sipho, although he was born in KZN, could play any feel. Sometime he’d joke, Does my bass line feel coloured enough?’

Fingerpicking ‘omasiganda’ troubadours, train-car yodels, raw slide guitar and haunting travel-weary ballads, from rare 78s all reissued here for the first time. A heavy duty document of a nearly lost scene, and all the songs are stunners to boot.

A Khmer blend of folk and pop, via wildly eclectic production techniques: cha-cha psychedelia, phase-shifting rock, sultry circle dance standards, pulsing new wave, haunted ballads, musical comedy sketches, easy listening, and raw, hard-grooving instrumentals. 
Then, after the cultural obliteration wrought by the Khmer Rouge, the music of the Cambodian diaspora in the 1980s and 1990s, beginning inside Thai refugee camps, from Khmer songs of the golden era to original music borrowing from both traditional and Western styles (romvong dance styles, maybe, or disco and new wave)."

In this period, klezmer music was venturing beyond its original role as Jewish wedding and celebratory music. It was proliferating in secular settings; sometimes disreputable, even underground. In the Odessa Stories, Isaac Babel mentions a bar with a house-band of ‘old Jews with dirty beards playing Romanian and Jewish tunes’; and klezmer would have been the soundtrack of the local brothels, pretty much all Jewish-owned. (One track here celebrates a new treatment for syphilis, Preparation 606… even lavishing a trumpet on proceedings.)
Tangy, exuberant, life-affirming music, high and low, mostly for dancing, featuring virtuosi like violinist Jascha Gegner and clarinettist Titunshnayder, presented with excellent notes."

A secret weapon in the arsenals of ska aficionados and selectors far east, Yakkosan is a hot Latinisation of Edo pop, with low-down jazz guitar, shuffling beat and theatrical singing.
On the flip, Hanagasa Odori is the bluesy, sultry iteration of a traditional dance rhythm of Yamagata prefecture, with tasty marimba and steel percussion.
A Japanese import; beautifully done."
Chiemi Eri,Otemoyan,King Japan,"Two superb Latin Jazz burners based on traditional Japanese melodies, still heady with the sexual and musical crossings of the clubs and brothels of US occupation.

A rough, electric, rural take on the classic Congolese, Kenyan and Mozambican urban dancefloor styles of the 60s and 70s — hyper-fast interplay between pumping bass and clattering drums, overlaid with cranked-up high-life guitar — nourished with the musical traditions of local villages, especially in the lovely singing and other passages of acoustic respite.

The first half of the twentieth century was a golden era in Tunisian music; Cheikh El Afrite its most celebrated artist. As a youngster he became fluent in its mix of classical Arab-Andalous and Ottoman traditions with folk idioms like bedouin and other African melodies, fondo and fezzani, and the festive tripolitain music of Libya. Turning professional at eighteen, he was soon singing for the bey every Tuesday night, at his seaside palace in Hammam Lif. Later, his recordings made him star throughout the Maghreb."

Emahoy Tsegue-Maryam Guebrou,,Mississippi,"A second helping from Mississippi. ‘Gebru is a true original,’ says the label. ‘Her playing is somewhere between Satie, Debussy, the liturgical music of the Coptic Ethiopian Church, and Ethiopian traditional music. It is some of the most moving piano music you will ever hear! All original compositions available for the first time on vinyl beyond the original early 1960s editions, which are completely impossible to find. Old school tip-on cover with gold foil printing. A must-have masterpiece for anyone who needs some spiritual comfort.’"

featuring Victor Assis Brasil, Edson Maciel and Jesse Sadoc; and backing vocals
from Jaime and Nair, Lucia Lins, Jurema and Marcio Lott.
Written by Joao Donato and Gilberto Gil, Emilio’s signature tune Bananeira always gets a party started right; Brother is a smooth-grooving killer with great horn arrangements and massed choir; La Mulata is a soulful, swinging salsa stepper."

Three mesmerising songs to start, including Habaitak Ta Neseet Al Naoum (I Loved You So Much I Forgot To Sleep), with ravishing strings and percussion. 
Recorded in Athens at the studios of EMI Greece during the same sessions as Zaid Rahbani’s Abu Ali LP, and likewise edging into funk and disco, the second side is something else. In Al Bostah (The Bus), a woman recalls a bus journey with a lover, in scorching heat, to extended, hypnotic, uptempo, funkdafied disco. The title track Wahdon crafts a slower, jazzier setting for Fairuz’ out-of-this-world singing.
Hotly recommended."

Folk And Pop Sounds Of Sumatra,Vol. 2,Sublime Frequencies,"‘From the 1960s through the 1980s, from the infectious trance beat of Dangdut music, featuring rabab (violin) or saluang (flute), to the highly-refined and glorious Orkes Gambus (orchestral Arab music with ouds), said to have been brought to the island by Islamic settlers from Yemen, the seventeen tracks here will instantly convince the listener of the expressive beauty and diversity this wondrous island has to offer to the world music theatre. Most of the musicians on this release are Minangkabau or Minang people who are devout followers of Islam as well as the world’s largest matrilineal society. The other styles present are Sitogol (storytelling in vocal style), pop Minang music with talempong (small, rounded gongs played with mallets), Tari and traditional Minang music for ceremony and dance… and one brilliant track of Western pop. Keep in mind that this is NOT a document for the mere purpose of preservation, although it may serve as such. This is among the very best music you’ve never heard and you need to hear it NOW!’"

The Harmony Kings International Band released its eponymous first album on Ekimogun Records, out of Benin City, in 1977. Issued in 1989 on the tiny G-E-T label, Onye Kata Obia is the General’s tribute to Ali Chukwuma — a spearhead of the new Anioma sound — who had died three years earlier.

George became firmly ensconced in the London scene. His Club Iroko — in Haverstock Hill, north London — was a creative hub for groups like Osibisa, and a home-away to the likes of Fela, Funkadelic and Sun Ra. He worked widely as a session musician (stuff from Georgie Fame to Quincy Jones), and that’s him on the soundtrack of Live And Let Die.

He was busking for his family by the time he was eight; nineteen when he made his first LP, with Paco De Lucia; dead at forty-two, from fags, whisky and drugs. 
Generally reckoned the greatest flamenco singer of all time, and a special favourite of Miles Davis.
(Cameron’s dad was a blacksmith, and taught him to sing: that’s an anvil on Las Doce Acaban De Dar.)"

Edited and mastered by CGB at D&M for maximum oomph and worries, and presented in a gatefold sleeve with cool and deadly varnishing. Plus a full-size booklet detailing the fascinating history of this music, seamed into the strange, tentacular byways of hand-to-hand vinyl distribution, record collecting and musical connoisseurship, and the soundclash traditions of the region, suffused with the politics and culture of the Black Atlantic, stretching back to the 1950s.

Vividly recorded by Renato Viola over just two days in 1976 — amidst HP’s session work for Flora Purim’s Open Your Eyes You Can Fly, OPA’s Goldenwings and Cal Tjader’s Amazona, amongst other classics — in an effort to capture the freer, improvisational, more spiritualised sound of the group’s Iive performances in this period (which might last for hours, without a break).

‘There was a radio station, a recording studio, a music label and a deep, cross-genre roster of artists. Beginning as simple gramophones connected to loudspeakers tied to lamp posts or trees, the aparelhagem sonora of Belém evolved into sophisticated setups, drawing thousands of revelers.

Deep tunes like Syka — fierce, electric jazz funk with wild clavinet, synth and trumpet solos. A highlight of Koute Jazz, Vini Couté E Tann’ is dazzling, funky biguine, with wicked piano and guitar playing by Patrick Jean-Marie and Gilbert Coco.

‘The resultant reinventions of Ben’s core repertoire are by no means re-treads. Her much booted and sampled Dia De Indio is strutting, dubby, electronic samba-funk; startlingly current and fresh. Her Boiadeiro rocks more furiously than Ben’s, with a throbbing heaviness and complexity; her Taj Mahal becomes a fashionably lush Brazilian boogie; her Santa Clara morphs into a deep electronic groove, underpinning the  precision, range and ravishing melancholy of her singing. The downbeat Que Pena — from Ben’s eponymous 1969 LP — turns funky samba, with tasty electric piano…’"

Mark Ernestus Presents Jeri-Jeri,Xale,Ndagga,"A next-level three-tracker, intense and roiling, featuring a mesmeric six-minute instrumental, with Thierno Sarr grooving out on the top string of his bass, adding an elusive Manding flavour to the deep Mbalax mix."
Mark Ernestus Presents Jeri-Jeri,Casamance,Ndagga,"A traditional Jola rhythm, with tuned, talking and kit drums swarming across scraps of guitar and the Mboups singing; then a more deeply dug-in, spaced-out funk, spun from a Serer rhythm. With full instrumentals."
Mark Ernestus Presents Jeri-Jeri,Bamba,Ndagga,"Rock-steady, slow-burning, hard funk, a kind of fatback Mbalax, in no mood to be messed with, with full vocal and instrumental versions; plus two vivid sketches, talking drums to the fore."
Mark Ernestus Presents Jeri-Jeri,Gawlo,Ndagga,"A rolling, resplendent tribute to griot life — ‘gawlo’, Fula for ‘griot’ — spear-headed by none other than Baaba Maal. Expressive interjections by a trio of talking drums are especially lucid on the instrumental."

Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force,Yermande,Ndagga,"Five years into the project, Yermande announces a thrilling new phase for this Dakar-Berlin collaboration: emphatically a giant step forward… and our outernational record of the year by a country mile.
The group of players is boiled down to twelve for recordings, eight for shows; sessions in Dakar become steeply more focussed. ‘This time around I was better able to specify what I wanted right from the initial recording sessions in Dakar,’ says Ernestus; ‘and further in the production process I took more freedom in reducing and editing audio tracks, changing MIDI data, replacing synth sounds and introducing electronic drum samples.’
Right away you hear music-making which has come startlingly into its own. Rather than submitting to the routine, discrete gradations of recording, producing and mixing, the music is tangibly permeated with deadly intent from the off. Lethally it plays a coiled, clipped, percussive venom and thumping bass against the soaring, open-throated spirituality of Mbene Seck’s singing. Plainly expert, drilled and rooted, the drumming is unpredictable, exclamatory, zinging with life. Likewise the production: intuitive and fresh but utterly attentive; limber but hefty; vividly sculpted against a backdrop of cavernous silence. 
Six chunks of stunning, next-level mbalax, then, funky as anything."

Marvellous Boy,Calypso From West Africa,Honest Jon's Records,"Marvellous Boy is the West African counterpart of the 1950s Soho scene of our series London Is The Place For Me. Calypso, highlife and jazz, brimming over with lust for life, topicality, and extravagant creativity."
Mary Afi Usuah,Ekpenyong Abasi,Voodoo Funk,"A stupendous blend of scintillating highlife, smoking Fela and spaced-out, funkdafied Black Jazz, from 1975 — Mari Affiong Usuah from Oron town, by way of Calabar in southeastern Nigeria, fronting a knockout band led by Daniel ‘Satch’ Asuquo from the Atomic 8 (and formerly of Bobby Benson’s orchestra).
The Afrofunk cuts are especially killer — with James Brown just percolating through by the end — but it’s a stunning, magnificent album, through and through.
Beautifully sleeved, too, with excellent notes by Uchenna from Comb & Razor. ‘Gob, smacked,’ he recalls, of his first listen; ‘mind, blown’."

A blend of pentatonic loveliness and raucous psychedelia, recorded over the past two years; acoustic songs on the fly, others during the shoot itself. Some of the instrumental music is the result of running out of gas in the bush twenty kilometres from the city, and toying around with a portable amplifier. Tunes with the full band were recorded in Marseille in single takes."

The tunes are mostly traditional Yoruban melodies, often sung at bed-time. The songs are mostly original, sung in Yoruba (though Jomido is an Egun song from the Badagry area of Lagos state)."

Piri,Voces Querem Mate?,Far Out,"A third Far Out visit to the fabulous Quartin catalogue, this debut LP by Piry Reis is far and away the most free-spirited of them all: groovy, ethereal Brazilian psych-folk at its finest, with percussionists Juquina and Wilson Das Neves and flautists Paulinho Jobim and Danilo Caymmi in full effect. Cuts like As Incríveis Peripécias De Danilo and Cupído Esculpido are tripped-out MPB; Sombra Morta and Chão Vermelho more shaded and melancholic. As per, re-mastered from the original 2” tapes, and properly pressed."

Tasty, infectious rhythms and synth-work — if the singing is a bit Black Box — with an up-for-it, DIY energy and self-identity encouraged by the momentum of the liberation struggle in this period. “Once Mandela was released from prison and people felt more free to express themselves and move around town, kwaito was becoming the thing,” says Thami."

Raoul Journo,Tresors De La Chanson Judeo-Arabe,Buda Music,"A follower of the celebrated Cheikh El Afrite, young Raoul taught himself oud, and sang solo for his local synagogue choir — also drawing inspiration from the munchid singing of Sulamia, the largest Sufi brotherhood in Tunisia. In 1934, aged twenty-three, his first album was a smash. Maghreb audiences revered him for his fidelity to his own national traditions, undistracted by more fashionable Lebanese and Egyptian styles.
Ya Samra hymns a prettily-tattooed, blushing, date-flavoured brunette; in Aala Khadek the dirty rascal fancies himself to be a bee, closing in on the delicious nectar secreted in the beauty spot of his beloved."

He stowed away to France and started singing in flamenco clubs in Paris. During the German occupation he passed as Muslim. 
In the fifties he ran the fancy Coq d’Or cabaret in Casablanca. Even the King rolled up.
When he sang in Israel in the sixties, he was forced from the stage after announcing in Arabic ‘Long live the Arab state’. Back home in Cannes, he recorded a version of the old vaudeville song My Yiddishe Momme, in Arabic.
He was openly gay throughout his adulthood.
He had one of the most beautiful voices of the modern Maghreb; he was a virtuoso darbuka player; his pelvis previewed Elvis.
Both Robert Mitchum and Umm Kulthum were fans. Not many singers can say that."

Shabara’s vocals are an expressive force, conjuring spirits from the soil with a deep, cosmic humility and respect for the land. 
‘Suryadi has built a new guitar for these tracks and pushes the Senyawa sound into new territory, utilizing delay, loops, and other effects to constitute groundings of folk, metal, punk and drone, for Shabara to explore with his whispered poetry and jagged, sharp-as-a-kris animistic powers.

Over time this Creole culture adopted Western instruments and traditional European forms like the quadrille and waltz, even as it articulated the cultural impact of hired workers from India. In the modern era, the gramophone brought all kinds of music to the mix; and violins and accordions were replaced by electric guitars, drums and keyboards, as psychedelic synths, fuzz and elastic bass lines re-cast the traditional polyrhythms of drums, ravannes, bongos, claves, triangles and maracas.

Omar Souleyman,Jazeera Nights: Folk And Pop Sounds Of Syria,Sublime Frequencies,"Representing fifteen years worth of live recordings. Frenzied Syrian dabke, Iraqi choubi and the mix of Arabic, Kurdish and Turkish styles unique to northeastern Syria."
Omar Souleyman,Haflat Gharbia (The Western Concerts),Sublime Frequencies,"Hot Syrian dabke — highlights from trail-blazing tours between 2009 and 2011. Clear, dynamic recordings; tearing performances, as anyone who went along will testify. Tufnell Park was a sozzled blinder."
Omar Souleyman,Leh Jani,Sham Palace,"The original Leh Jani cassette, with the title track unfurling its full thirty-minute splendour, alongside two more extended sizzlers. Mouth-watering new label from Sublime Frequencies’ Mark Gergis."

An overture played by two ketchapis (a kind of two-string ukulele), a serenar (a wind instrument) and a metal spoon against a bottle; a work-song, and a blessing; a Muslim dance, or sawat, in a fishing village. From Bali, a ‘sitting dance’ performed by a local gamelan orchestra, and a suite of drums and gamelan music in honour of a barong, half lion and half dog; and two examples of music for cremation ceremonies."

Star Band De Dakar,Psicodelia Afro Cubana De Senegal,Ostinato Records,"Fronted by legends like Youssou N’Dour and Laba Sosseh, the music of the Star Band is a dazzling blend of Cuban and Senegalese sounds. Changüí, Guajira, Salsa, and Son mingled with cosmic Mbalax guitars, Sabar rhythms, Afro-Latin horns, and Spanish vocals spiced with a Senegalese twang. 
Here is the cream of their deepest, most out-there Afro-Cubanismo, recorded with just two microphones and a four-track Revox, in the Le Miami club, Dakar.
Remastered in the original mono; with a twelve-page booklet including a rare interview with guitarist Yakhya Fall and vintage photos from his personal collection."

Staring Into The Sun,Ethiopian Tribal Music,Sublime Frequencies,"Recent recordings of Ethiopian tribal music, from remote highlands to sweaty Addis beerhalls. Songs from the Azmari, poet-musicians who play the ancient krar lyre, everything from comic improvisation to lyrical elegy; the Borana, whose polyphonic work-songs stop time and transcend place; and the Dirashe, whose syncopated panpipes are as otherworldly as it gets. The artwork features some of Olivia Wyatt’s great Polaroids."

Tarawangsawelas,Wanci,Morphine,"The Bandung duo — joined here by Pupung Supena and Pak Jaja — renewing the minimalist ritual music of Sundanese West Java, for a two-stringed bowed instrument itself called a tarawangsa, and the jentreng, a seven-stringed instrument, like a kecapi. Slow, mystical grooves gradually develop more repetitive and hypnotic rhythms, putting the listener and dancer into a trance. 
‘Wanci’... my nickname at school."

‘In the Zamrock family-tree, The Boyfriends — from Chamboli Mine Township in Kite — supplied the founding members of Zamrock’s most famous band, WITCH, and one of its best, Peace. From 1975, Black Power sounds like nothing else in the canon: a lost message drifiting in from the flower power era, imbued with a fiery Zambian voice.’ 
‘Zamrock came to embody the economic despair that followed the 1973-1974 oil crisis, which flung Zambia into recession and exacerbated a wide range of social tensions. Much of Zamrock also captured the controversy of wider politics in Africa and the world. Perhaps the finest example of this is Black Power by The Peace’ (The Guardian)."

Them Mushrooms,EP,Afro 7,"Four chunks of scintillating, hard-grooving, vintage afro-funk from coastal Kenya, drawn from rare sevens and a privately pressed LP.
It opens and closes with killer forays into left-field disco, featuring limber percussion and delirious synths, and breakdowns set to liquify dancefloors. Uru Wamiel catches the double-dutch bus to Mombasa, whilst Ndogo Ndogo is irresistibly reminiscent of early eighties New York crossover funk like Monyaka, with clattering drums, rough rhythm guitar, party-down bass, burning horns and all-together-now singing.
Lovely music, beautifully presented in die-cut, silk-screened sleeves."

Time Wept,"Vocal Recordings From The Levant, 1906-1925",Honest Jon's Records,"Stunningly beautiful, poignant music from Bilād al-Shām — ‘the countries of Damascus’, known nowadays as Syria, Lebanon and Palestine — including performances from the very first recording sessions in the region.
The legendary, moody Beirut singer Būlus Ṣulbān is here — some historians have him singing before Egypt’s Pasha Ibrāhīm Bāshā during his military campaign in Syria, in 1841 — and Ḥasība Moshēh, Jewish ‘nightingale of the Damascene gardens’. Thurayyā Qaddūra from Jerusalem; Yūsuf Tāj, a folk singer from Mount-Lebanon; Farjallāh Baiḍā, cousin to the founders of Baidaphon Records… Musical directors like the lutist Qāsim Abū Jamīl al-Durzī and the violinist Anṭūn al-Shawwā (followed by his son Sāmī); such virtuosi as the qanun-players Nakhleh Ilyās al-Maṭarjī and Ya‘qūb Ghazāla, and lutist Salīm ‘Awaḍ.
Even at the time, notwithstanding such brilliance, public music-making was frowned upon as morally demeaning, especially for women. Musical venues were generally dodgy. Ṣulbān once cut short a wedding performance for the Beiruti posh, after just one song, he was so disgusted with his audience. 
‘If I had to tell you about the catcalls,’ one commentator wrote about the musical theatre of the time, ‘the stomping of feet, the sound of sticks hitting the ground, the noise of the water-pipes, the teeth cracking watermelon seeds and pistachio nuts, the screams of the waiters, and the clinking of arak glasses on the tables, I would need to go on and on and on…’"

Salegy is the electrified updating of the traditional Antsa style from the north-west of the island — 6/8 rhythms, layered with percussion and call-and-response vocals — and the Vetson’ Androy group one of its most popular proponents. 
From 1978, Mavandeza has the heady urgency of killer Fela — with two women singers out front, psychedelic organ and prowling-lion bass.
The flip is from a decade later, by Malagasy superstar Eusebe Jaojaby — rough and tough dancefloor worries, with a mazy string-line, mash-it-down percussion and lilting flute.  
Another ace from Sofrito."
Victor Assis Brasil,Toca Antonio Carlos Jobim,Far Out,"Returning to Brazil from Berklee College of Music in the summer of 1970, and teamed up with legends like Edison Lobo and Edison Machado, the young saxophonist turned the national comforts of classic bossa inside out, reconstituting it as raw, deep, post-bop Latin jazz, astride both continents.

The mighty, game-changing, iconic Asnakech in narcotic, bare-bones performances from 1975. Her singing and virtuosic krar-playing are intensely gripping throughout, accompanied by Hailu Mergia’s cosmic, zonked organ, and Temare Harege’s ultra-minimal brush-work and foot-pedal, like a barely audible drum-machine.

Musicians include Wackies regulars like Owen Stewart and Oral Cooke from Itopia, and Ras Menilik and Jah T; also Sleepy’s multi-instrumentalist spar Myrie Dread from the In The Light sessions for Hungry Town.

And that’s only a secret-weapon version of None Shall Escape The Judgement on the other side, with Owen Grey at the mic.
Raging Tubbys fire."
Bobby Sarkie,Over And Over,Wackies,"Rudie will recognise Bobby Sarkie from The Tartans and The Immortals (not to mention his solo roots killer Better World). His singing here is expertly reined in by desolation, numbness and regret, over a hollowed-out, mesmeric rhythm, with some nasty synth-work and casually brilliant effects on the drums. The vocal cut is more than a minute longer than the version which opens the Jah Son Invasion album with such a flourish; and the mix is different, with more prominent keys, and toned-down bass. It’s previously unreleased, like the dub.
The B-side is booby-trapped with sensational instrumental excursions on Junior Delahaye’s Working Hard For The Rent Man and Jackie Mittoo’s almighty Drum Song, which conclude the same original tape-reel as Over And Over. Rent Rebate features masterful, boppish soprano saxophone-playing by Roland Alphonso, and restrained guitar interjections by Barry Vincent, with a Spanish tang. The superb hand-drumming on Mount Zion is by Ras Menelik; and it’s Mittoo himself on organ (or just maybe Clive Hunt, Wackies can’t quite remember)."

Just around the corner from Honest Jon’s in Ladbroke Grove, guitarist Peter Harris went on to set up the Kickin label (which put out Shut Up And Dance, Aaron Carl and Blaze)."
Annette Brissett,Love Power,Wackies,"Originally out in 1983, Love Power is co-produced by Fabian Cooke (from Itopia) and Lloyd Bullwackie Barnes, with assistance from Prince Douglas. Cooke plays most of the instruments himself, with his drumming centre-stage, though Ras Menelik puts in a brilliant shift on congas, and backing vocals are by Sugar Minott and the Love Joys. Cooke’s own well-crafted compositions are joined by covers of Irene Cara and the Four Tops, infectiously bridging roots, lovers and synthy, soulful eighties boogie. 
Betrayed is solid-gold, signature Wackies. He’s My God is a tasty sip of low-slung, grooving gospel-reggae. Evoking Michael Jackson, the jamming album-closer Drums is top-notch disco-reggae, opportunely poised for revival.
Terrific stuff, full of personality, charm and in-ting hybridity. "
Annette Brissett,Betrayed,Wackies,"Deep, rootical lovers, darkly seething with one-step-at-a-time hurt and steely, vengeful self-esteem. Hypnotic, stripped and desolate, with implacable drums and bass, dubwise from the start, the production is classic, unmistakable Wackies, featuring Fabian Cooke’s scattered, abrupt organ stabs and minimal guitar-work, Ras Menelik’s masterful nyabinghi drumming, and harmonic commiseration by Sugar Minott and the Love Joys (with a strangled sob at intervals). 
Over six minutes, the extended mix is different to the Love Power LP; and the additional dub, released here for the first time, is unmissable for its extra rawness and dubbed-out emptiness.
Plus thirteen minutes of blissful disco-reggae on the flip: two contrasting dubs of the Giorgio Moroder/Irene Cara/Flashdance cut from Love Power, both previously unreleased and a bit sick."

Drifter and Skylarking put in appearances; and two full Joe Auxumite vocals from the solo album scheduled for release around this time, but abandoned when most of the tapes were lost. A dub version of Delroy Wilson’s Rain From The Skies rounds out proceedings."
Bunny Lee & The Aggrovators,Super Dub Disco Style,Pressure Sounds,"A strong set of dubs mixed by Tubby’s proteges Pat Kelly and Stanley ‘Barnabas’ Bryan.
“I think I did a lot of things that nobody explored at Tubby’s before,” remembers Kelly. “I get better quality recording, separation of sound that you could call stereo… I was more the vocal man who mix vocal – not that I didn’t like dub, but I gave vocals my special attention. I like the blend of instruments. If you listen to my mix it’s a blend, nothing really sticking out sometime. A lot of other dubs, something sticks out, or becomes contrary or overloaded. I didn’t mix like that. I liked it to be musical. It wasn’t very hard, because most of them were very good songs, they were unique songs, so you couldn’t generally go wrong.”

Cornell Campbell,Hey Mr. Cop,Firehouse / Dub Store,"Typically fine singing, over crisp, bare Tubbys digi, with strong backing vocals on both sides. 
Hey Mr. Cop is a draft of the song he recorded for Bunny Lee, over Rumours; the flip does over his Jammys smash.
Dubplate action."
Cornell Campbell,Jah Give Us Love,Pressure Sounds,"Four brisk steppers cuts of the Cornell Campbell roots classic, produced by Roy Cousins. CC himself; a minimal, dubwise Prince Far I; a Charlie Chaplin; a dub."
Cornell Campbell,Give The Little Man A Great Big Hand,Pressure Sounds,"Nice, sincere version of the William DeVaughn classic. Cornell is well-suited to the song, though Tubby’s dub says everything that needs to be said."

Carlton Hunter,You Know Why,Union,"Over the same almighty rhythm as Jacob Miller’s Who Say Jah No Dread. 
With more heartfelt, well-constructed lovers on the flip, by one Pete Campbell.
Obscure, but seemingly first released in the UK, in 1980."
Carlton Manning,We Will Live & Love,Gay Feet / Dub Store,"Gorgeous singing by Carlton (from Carlton & The Shoes and The Abyssinians), with tasty nyabinghi drumming in the accompaniment.
“I was writing songs but I didn’t record until 1968. I did one song for Lee Scratch Perry. He gave me £5 and then I didn’t hear anything more about it. Then I went down to Mrs Pottinger, did one song for her named Live and Love on the Gay Feet label. It was played on the radio for a couple of days and it wasn’t going anywhere really because she had some good artists down there at the time and they did some songs that were doing well, so my song wasn’t getting much promotion and it wasn’t being played. I think I heard it twice on the radio and then I didn’t hear it anymore.”"

Lacksley Castell,Tug-A-War Games,Pressure Sounds,"LC made killer records for Lee Perry, Jammys and Rockers International — and surely this is a classic, missing-in-action Augustus Pablo production (with AP himself on melodica)... with a third-party dub. The vocal cut is fab. The bass will be murders through scoops.
Coupled with a soulful Royals, produced — naturally — by Roy Cousins, with an eye on Gamble and Huff."

John Clarke,Visions Of John Clarke / Rootsy Reggae,Wackies,"Visions Of John Clarke was a little thrown together for its original release in 1979. Still, its sleeve carried a ringing endorsement from Bullwackies himself — ‘President of the John Clarke Fan Club’."
John Clarke,Big Leg Mary,Wackies,"‘Double-sided murder Wackie’s from 1978. Originally released on the Jumbo Caribbean Disco label from Brooklyn. Big Leg Mary is on the same rhythm as Wayne Jarrett’s killer Come Let’s Go. Wasn’t It You is a different cut from the earlier one on the Senrab label, but equally lethal.

Johnny Clarke,Creation Rebel,VP,NA
Johnny Clarke,Golden Snake,Atom / Dub Store,"A Keith Hudson production with a strong whiff of Studio One to its bumping rhythm. JC typically bosses this song about requited love, which gives no clue where the golden snake comes in.

Ras Clifton,Queen Of The Universe,Wackies,"Ras Clifton’s delirious hymn to Black womanhood is backed by the original Wackies crew — Allah, Clive Hunt, the Sylvester Brothers. Look Over Yonder originally appeared in 1975, as a 7-inch on the Wisdom-Rock label which Wackies created for Clifton: this 1982 reworking is more spacious and contemplative.
Deep, charged reggae with musical inspiration to spare over extended mixes — and Lloyd Barnes at the desk steals the show.
Back in."
Clive Field Marshall,Poor House Rockers,Wackies,"On its original release in 1981, this deejay album sold out so quickly that Wackies was unable to supply his customary distributors outside New York; and it has been high on Wackies-collectors’ lists ever since."
Clive Wilson & The Skatalites,"One Ska, One Ounce Of Weed, One Beer",Federal,"Previously a super-scarce JA blank. Hail the almighty Don D’s scorching solo — flashing a split-second premonition of Rico on Message To You, Rudy."

Coxsone's Music,The First Recordings Of Sir Coxsone The Downbeat 1960-62,Soul Jazz,"Surely there’s a word missing from the sub-title. Ivan was terrible; Coxsone wasn’t downbeat. Coxsone was the Downbeat Ruler, with the Downbeat Sound System, spinning fabulous tunes like these.

Caribbean disco at its best, both sides."
Anthony Creary,Land Call Africa,Digikiller,"The drummer of the Gladiators Band and the Upsetters, recording with his own Solid Foundation Band at the Black Ark in the down-time of a Junior Byles’ session. A rework of The Animals’ version of an English folk song, with a leg-up from Byles’ own A Place Called Africa. Originally released on Sight’N'Sound, by Studio One.

Junior Delahaye,Movie Show,Wackies,"Issued originally in 1981, with white or blue Wackies labels, with and without information stamped on. The A differs from the album cut; the dub is right up there with Bullwackies’ - anybody’s - best."
Junior Delahaye,Showcase,Wackies,"Originally released in 1982 this album recasts Philadelphia-style sweet soul within the shimmering, bass-heavy textures of classic Wackies dub, with spine-chilling results.
Includes interpretations of Billy Stewart’s ‘Sitting in the Park’ and Fuzz’s Sigma-recorded 1971 smash ‘I Love You For All Seasons’, alongside the reggae evergreen ‘Travelling Man’; together with three fabulous Delahaye originals. Features such Wackies stalwarts as Jerry Harris, Jah T and Roland Alphonso. JA-born Junior Delahaye remains co-engineer; of course Lloyd Bullwackie Barnes is the producer."

Shaka tune."
Dennis Creary,Ghetto Life,Dug Out,"Tearaway sufferers anthem, roaring out of the blocks in 1989. Piercing, unforgettable song-writing by the Tetrack spar — jam-packed with anecdote, observation and warning — over a sick, breakneck, apocalyptic rhythm, with an ace dub. A digi classic."

Prince Douglas,Dub Roots,Wackies,"Besides Sugar’s International Herb, this 1980 dub album is engineer Douglas Levy’s finest work. Many of the rhythms are derived from a tape given to the studio by Sly and Robbie, containing their versions of recent Joe Gibbs hits. And there are brilliant treatments of Tribesman Dub — the rhythm for Tyrone Evans’ Black Like Me — and Wayne Jarrett’s definitive interpretation of Every Tongue Shall Tell. Elsewhere Jah Batta takes deejay duties — likewise Prince Douglas himself. (And there are lovely skewed graphics by team regular Leslie Moore, self-styled ‘LAM International’). But the deadliest cut of all reworks another gift, Steel Pulse’s Handsworth Revolution, which arrived in a parcel of records from England the same weekend as the session: March Down Babylon Dub, with Bullwackie himself at the microphone in his Chosen Brothers guise, as steely and apocalyptic as Douglas Levy’s fabulous production."

Apparently the Brothers were fed up with Berry Gordy pushing them around… but it’s timeless, universal advice: ‘Sock it to your neighbour / Sock it to your mother / It’s your thing / Do what you want to do.’"
Alton Ellis,Alphabetically Yours,Treasure Isle,NA
Alton Ellis,Love To Share,Radiation,Mister Soul in 1979 — arranged and co-produced by Jackie Mittoo.
Bobby Ellis,Step Softly,Crystal / Dub Store,All-time killer rebel-sound instrumental.
Bobby Ellis,Sweet Lorna,Treasure Isle,"Lorn ain’t no fawn, by the sounds of it; sweet, not petite. 
Hefty and haughty, deft and doughty, prowling through Rome. 
Previously available only as a pre-release, back in the day.
Backed with a very rare, early sighting of Norman Grant from the Twinkle Brothers, gospelizing with Tommy McCook And The Supersonics. Previously unreleased."

Hortense Ellis,Jah Mysterious Works,Digikiller,NA
Noel Ellis,To Hail Selassie,Summer Records,"First son to Alton Ellis, Noel is the second voice on Willie Wiliams’ Rocking Universally, as DJ Papa Cousin; and here his singing compellingly emulates the Messenger Man’s enraptured, slightly slurred, incantatory delivery, at the same time casting off his dad’s old-school demonstrativeness. Still, the song takes its inspiration from Alton’s sublime Hurting Me, on his Sunday Coming LP for Studio One, and Jackie Mittoo is fittingly amongst the musicians on call for the re-working; also Johnny Osbourne and Bongo Gene on percussion.
‘I were trying to achieve my own sound,’ the producer Jerry Brown has recalled. ‘We didn’t copy Channel One; we just tried to do our own thing, y’know? Them sounds are dangerous, man… Dangerous!’
Sure enough, To Hail Selassie is almighty murder. Stone classic reggae. Rocking and ruff, wasted and odd, hypnotic and super-atmospheric, it finds its own imperious way in the same Black Ark fall-out as the best of Bullwackies and Half Moon.
Both sides complete with dubs, in different mixes to the Light In The Attic LP. Reissued by Iroko.
Very strongly recommended."
Noel Ellis,Memories,Summer Records,"A heartbreakingly soulful lament about the losses entailed by his emigration to Canada in the early 1970s, as a young Jamaican teenager; with the same reverberative musical spaciousness and detailing as the most sublime Upsetters. (The homonymous Junior Murvin song comes to mind.)  Written by Tony Hibberts — nephew of Winston Francis — who also plays bass.
Plus Dance With Me on the flip, a bit more party hearty; as sampled by poor Kanye West.
Both sides with dubs, in different mixes to the Light In The Attic LP."

Guardian Angel,China Gate,Matumbi,"Only the brave or foolish have a go at the invincible Nat King Cole, but this is a magnificent version of his song in Samuel Fuller’s eponymous 1957 war film. Unmissable female-vocal UK roots — hybridising the great tradition of interpretations by Sun Ra, Ramsey Lewis and co — produced by Bagga and Winston Fergus in 1979. The stately, harmonica-led dub commemorates Gooseberry Studios at 19 Gerrard Street in London’s Chinatown, where Matumbi recorded."
Half Moon,"Glory, Dominion, Majesty, Power",PK,"The gnarliest reggae compilation in Christendom, drawn from the seventies and early-eighties heyday of this Toronto-based label, when it played host to stars like Joe Higgs and Augustus Pablo. Raw, twisted, compelling, time-and-again staggering productions by Oswald Creary — in the tradition of his childhood-friend Lloyd Bullwackie Barnes — but utterly themselves. Rough, tough, mystical roots.

The flip steals the show — pure Wackies bubbling up live and direct, with Baba-Leslie under-pinning, big-city guitar, mystic, wailing synths and a soulfully apocalyptic, unknown vocalist. Previously unreleased; unmissable.

Keith Hudson,Flesh Of My Skin Blood Of My Blood,Basic Replay,"Originally released in 1974, Flesh Of My Skin is Keith Hudson’s key achievement: magnificently and deadly serious, hauntingly unique."
Keith Hudson,Playing It Cool And Playing It Right,Basic Replay,"It was intended that one of Hudson’s teenage sons would voice the dubs. In the event the Love Joys, Wayne Jarrett, and most inimitably Hudson himself featured at the microphone. Like Wackies, Hudson was a Studio One devotee — ‘I used to hold Don Drummond’s trombone for him so I can be in the studio’ — and the album follows Coxsone’s recent strategy of overdubbing signature rhythms. 
The Studio One sides were aimed at the dancefloor; Hudson’s reworks of tracks like Melody Maker are more psychological. Heavy Barrett Brothers rhythms are pitched down and remixed deeper still with reverb, filters and other distortion, and overlaid with new recordings of guitar, percussion, keyboard, voice, often crazily treated. 
Originally released in 1981 on the Joint International label, in NYC. 
Legendary, strange, compelling music."
Keith Hudson,Entering The Dragon,Trojan,"Essential Keith Hudson albums (like the Basic Replay reissues) are out of this world. Entering The Dragon isn’t one of them — but with all the extras, some of them top-drawer, this set runs to thirty tracks, and it’s a steal."
Keith Hudson,Pick A Dub,VP,"Deep and intense, with Augustus Pablo and the Barrett Bros on call, god-like Tubbys mixing, canonical rhythms, Big Youth and Horace Andy in the mix. One of the top five dub albums of all time. Forty years old!"

The overall mood is foreboding, sombre and distressed. ‘Your trouble wanna trouble you,’ warns Gregory. ‘War in the morning, war in the evening.’ ‘Everyone is wondering who will be next.’ 
The gist is the toll of everyday living — paranoia and alienation, loneliness and heartbreak, drugs and violence — and the gravitational pull of prison, so it’s great to see the emblematic art-work of the original UK issue, by the aptly-named Serious Business, back again. (We miss the Rudy Gone Whaling typo of an old bootleg, still.) 
Typically dapper, trash-and-ready reissue by Dub Store in Tokyo, with ace sound, handsomely sleeved (though the tracks are listed in the wrong order).
Masterworks like Long Sentence, Once A Man — giant-slaying Fade Away excursion — and Badness.
Hotly recommended."
Gregory Isaacs,Out Deh!,Tad's,NA
Gregory Isaacs,Steal A Little Love,Jammy's / Dub Store,NA
Gregory Isaacs,Nobody Knows,Dug Out,"Just like cream-of-the-crop digi Tubbys. From the New Dance album sessions in 1988, with the Firehouse Crew. Mixed by Leroy ‘Fatman’ Thompson — formerly apprenticed to the King, en route to Jammys — and produced by Bunny Gemini and Tristan Palma. Gregory is desolate and compelling… and the dub is murder."
Gregory Isaacs,Temporary Lover,Dug Out,"Masterful Gregory from 1997, sounding spooked and hunted over a juddering, propulsive Music Works rhythm, fulgent and full-on, with deep, pounding bass, clattering percussion, parping horns, classy backing vocals and harp starbursts… top-notch Gussies.
Two extended vocal versions, and two dubs, all quite different.
Bimmety bim bim."

Wayne Jarrett,Showcase Vol. 1,Wackies,"Recorded at Bullwackies just weeks apart from Horace Andy’s Dance Hall Style: two of the very greatest vocal reggae LPs of all time. 
Between stints in JA for legends like Glen Brown and Junjo Lawes, WJ commuted to the Bronx from Connecticut. With Clive Hunt in full effect, Showcase follows the six-track dubwise format of Dance Hall Style (Wayne never sounding more like Horace), including four utterly lethal Studio One versions — Azul’s killer Rockfort Rock, Sleepy’s Every Tongue (with outrageous Isleys fuzz), yet another Wackies’ Heptones via Leroy Sibbles, and a murderous Drum Song.
Hotly recommended."

Produced by Adrian Sherwood; with George Oban from the original Aswad crew, playing bass."
Jerry Hitler,Too Much Religion,Digikiller,"Super rough and tough Rawse monster; mid-seventies Bullwackies. JH aka Jerry Harris grabs you by the curly locks from the off, over a skeletal, dubwise one-away, with nervy guitar, scurvy synth and insouciant hi-hat. The message is enmir’d in self-righteousness in no time, but for a couple of verses rudeboy’s in heaven. An absolute must."

Mabrak,Drum Talk,Dug Out,"Leroy Mattis’ first drum was a plastic butter container. ‘My mother wouldn’t buy me a drum because back then the situation in Jamaica was very tense… In 1960 Jamaica was still an English colony, and the drum is a roots instrument.’ Tommy McCook was living two doors down; during the first years of The Skatalites, Mattis would practise there. In 1970 he was National Junior Drumming Champion, with Count Ossie winning overall; four years later his ensemble battled in the Senior finals with the drummers of the Light Of Saba.
‘Our group was initially called Genesis, it was a 7-piece drum group, but I changed the name to Mabrak, which means Thunder in Amharic. We knew that we were coming with a heavy sound.’
Experiments in percussion, in the middle of the night at Harry J’s. Funky versions of rhythms like Curly Locks and Too Late To Turn Back Now, led by talking drums. Blaxploitation is in the air… the Staples… even a blast of Barry White. Beautifully mixed by King Tubby, who couldn’t believe his ears. 
Originally released in 1976, in paper inners only. Smartly sleeved in quintessential Dug Out style this time around — with an insert, including a recent interview with Mabrak."

Ras Michael And The Sons Of Negus,Promised Land Sounds,Dug Out,"‘Rockin live ruff and tuff’, this is the untrammelled counterpart to Dadawah, six years later in 1980, fresh from the Upsetter: free, rawly spiritual trance-music; a full-force nyabinghi freak-out.
The drummers are headlong and rollicking, thunderous and explosive. Even more so than Dadawah, the mix is ecstatically echoey; giddily dubwise without let-up. Ras Michael himself sings from the mountain-top, like he just don’t care — at the top of his lungs, in voices, screeching like a bird — with the delirious abandonment otherwise owned in reggae by Lee Perry. Amongst the uncredited performances swirled into proceedings, there are squiggles of flute straight from the Upsetters song-book, the minor-key organ stabs and abstraction of electric space-jazz, and sax-playing more attuned to the Headhunters than the Blazing Horns. (I Ya I in particular is a stunning fifteen minutes.)
This is the real thing, music without affectation. Pure reggae. Sun Ra fans should love it; anyone with ears to hear. 
Prepared and manufactured at Abbey Road, D&M and Pallas; beautifully presented in rigid, old-school, tip-on sleeves, with matt-coated fronts and untreated-paper backs; 180g vinyl.
‘These sounds are sounds of inspiration and love and culture to the universal benefit of mankind… So therefore meditate and stop hate.’
Very hotly recommended."
Ras Michael And The Sons Of Negus,Numbered Days,Dug Out,"Magnificent nyabinghi roots warning.
The one-and-only Eric Frater is drafted in from Studio One, playing killer rhythm guitar (with Chinna on lead); and likewise Dennis Ferron — Jah D — who leads the way with his spiritualized keyboard-work, keening between jazz and soul. You can hear Puma from Black Uhuru, singing with the Sons. Geoffrey Chung at Dynamic expertly pulls in the bass drum and doubled-up fundas and repetas, keeping the mix raw and alive.  
The dub in particular is stunning — thumping, trenchant and brooding, so steeply dread and haunted it almost trips over its sense of yawning silence and doom."
Michael Anthony,Living In Sorrows,Third Generation,NA
Michael Flint,Move In Out A Rome,Ranking Joe,"Two great sides: MF in fine sufferers style on a flinty Roots Radics version of No More Will I Roam (though you can’t refine Niney); and a vibesing Rockfort Rock from Ranking Joe, on the flip."

Sugar Minott,Unity,Archive,"Top-quality, previously-unreleased Sugar, in fine voice at Joe Gibbs. Strong rhythm, too, rich and moody."
Sugar Minott,Come Again,SMP,"Biff! Knockout Sugar Booger Minott. Ace mid-eighties co-production with Bertie ‘Stamma’ Grant (whose Omega Studios in London was more accustomed to turning out Lovers — Jean Adebambo, Carol Thompson and co — at this time). Killer bubblers, with a sick dub. Another Shaka weapon bites the dust."

Sugar Minott,Can't Stop Jah Music,Preacher Cleavie Jefferey / Jah Fingers,"Vintage UK digital, animated by Sugar; a Shaka tune in the day.

The Minstrels,People Get Ready,Studio One / Dub Store,"Sublimely versioning the almighty Curtis anthem; with another rocksteady clarion-call on the flip, brassy and more stern, by The Hamlins."
The Minstrels,Hey There Lonely Girls,Merritone / Dub Store,Pure loveliness from 1967 — with an acappella version.
Jackie Mittoo,Ayatollah,Basic Replay,"An apocalyptic record, full of dread — dubwise and deep from the first interstellar chords, over Wackies-style steppers drum and bass — with a dream-like atmosphere of pain and sufferation, mystery and redemption."
Jackie Mittoo,The Sniper,17 North Parade,NA
Jackie Mittoo And The Soul Brothers,Last Train To Skaville,Soul Jazz,"‘The Soul Brothers possess a Crystal Clear Sound. Obviously it would be better to Cut the Chatter and Spin the Platter.’ Instrumentals by the awesome Studio One house band led by Jackie Mittoo and Roland Alphonso, 1965-67."

Mojo Nya,Freedom For Trots,Wackies,"From the last wave of Digikiller reissues, but so nice we up it twice. 
Terrific, deep, mystical roots, protesting the imprisonment of Desmond Trotter for the 1974 murder of a US tourist in Domenica. (Trots was fingered by a young lady from Antigua called Pretty Pig, the court was told.) 
Originally released on the Jumbo Caribbean Disco label run by Brooklyn’s African Record Center shop. Discomixes, both sides.
Don’t miss it."
The Monarchs,All Of Me,Kentone / Dub Store,"Opportunity knocking once. Mid-tempo doowop-ska. On the flip, the Sneer Towners, hardly a household name themselves."

Joe Morgan,Forward Ever,Digikiller,"Bringing together two sevens originally released in Jamaica on the Afro Black label, in the mid-seventies. Rootical domestics, soulfully delivered, over tight, funky playing. You Let Me Down is Wackies’ sublime Black Harmony rhythm, no less. 
Collectors’ heaven, utilising Joe ‘Basement Session’ Morgan’s own imprint Fish Tea, going since the 1980s."
Joe Morgan,Stop Them,Digikiller,"Throw down your tin-pan bootleg and come.
Heavyweight roots originally released in late-seventies NY on the singer’s own JoMor Music House label, under the name Billy Joe Morgan. Tough horns, with Joe deftly recycling Freddie McKay’s Rock A Bye Woman, in magnificent discomixes.
Watch out you don’t miss the killer digi excursion Warrior, from ten years later, storming up the rear."
Joe Morgan,As It Was Written,Digikiller,"A fine mid-seventies excursion on the murderous Black Harmony rhythm.
‘Produced by Joe Morgan’, surprisingly enough. Turns out he produced this Soul Syndicate rhythm track back in 1975, together with vocals by Don Carlos et al, all mixed by Tubby’s. Moving to the Bronx soon afterwards with the tapes in his luggage, Joe decided on Wackies as the best outlet… As it was written, indeed."

Sixy Morris,Me Nuh Response,Digikiller,"Irresistibly body-rocking, early-nineties digi — with vivid spaghetti detailing, as the unflappable Sixy keeps it holstered, and coolly rides west on a murderous b-line, rearin’ and careerin’ into the sunset."
Pablo Moses,Revolutionary Dream,Only Roots,"His masterwork, from 1975. Great songs — a tough mix of mysticism, politics and philosophy — with Robbie Lyn from the Sound Dimension, Geoffrey Chung gently testing the reggae envelope, Clive Hunt from Wackies, a sprinkling of Black Ark, masterful drumming by Horsemouth… and PM’s compelling voice."
Moses,Live It Up,Tuff Scout,"Wow… the triumphant comeback of the indomitable King Culture. Super-heavy, Radics-style, wrecking-ball rhythm; proper singing; tough dub. The mixing of the harmony singing is magical."

‘Real gone scorcher,’ as Iny would say."
Augustus Pablo,The Sun,Dug Out,"First time out for this wildly raw dubplate, sister-recording to the Pablo master-rhythm, shot through with other-worldly, illusively allusive incantation.
Surely that’s Family Man stalking a sunken cavern, and his bro battering all seven shades out of his drum-kit, like Meters on fire; and Chinna on guitar, glazed and violent. The mixing rears up right in your face. 
Producer Gussie Clarke says Theophilus ‘Easy Snappin’ Beckford is playing piano, with the front removed so he can strum the strings (like he finally snapped) — but he credits the work overall to Augustus Pablo. 
Transferred from acetate — fuss-pots don’t grumble, just be humble — though the flip brings a clutch of criss, unmissable alternates, direct from Gussie’s tape-room (where the files are entitled ‘Classical Illusion / The Sun’).

Woman’s Dub is astounding, still — a dub of Jimmy Riley doing Bobby Womack’s Woman’s Gotta Have It. ‘She’s gotta know she’s not walking on shaky ground,’ run the lyrics — amidst the awesome musical evocation of the far end of the Richter scale.
Hotly recommended at HJ for decades."
Lee Perry,Cow Thief Skank,Wizzdom,"Stupefying Upsetters genius — splicing together the rhythms of Better Days and Musical Transplant like Doctor Funkenstein himself, whilst Charlie Ace barks at Dinah the missus to get out of bed and pass him his trousers and an axe, there’s a cow-thief in the garden, needs his fingers chopped off."

The grievously under-recorded AP’s searing rebuttal of domestic violence — longing and defiance shadowed by humiliation and desolation, over a deadly, sombre Channel One rhythm — backed with a tough roots excursion, fizzing with star-wars special effects, by Hands & Heart (who also recorded with Augustus Pablo and Lee Perry for Hungry Town, around the same time).

And he always telling me, ‘Well, kid, first of all you should be in school. You’re smoking too much weed. Several big men try to do this. You’re a kid. Nobody not gonna allow you to mix.’ I would keep on bugging him, bugging him, bugging him. But he always just had me doing TV repairs, fixing the amplifiers and stuff for him. One day when Jammy failed to come — like he always do most of the time — Tubby’s made me a bet. He said, I bet if I send you around there to work, you wouldn’t know the first thing to do.

Reggae is the word that hits at the heartstrings the mind can’t control. I and I get the message of Rastafari out through reggae. It is the black music line of message to the world. It is the black Rastaman line of message to the world. It is the metaphorical Black Star Line’ (Ras Michael)."

Tapes Meets The Drums Of Wareika Hill Sounds,Datura Mystic,Honest Jon's Records,"This started out a couple of years ago as a grounation drumming session above the old headquarters of the Mystic Revelation Of Rastafari, in Wareika Hill, Kingston, JA. Four funde, a repeta and a bass drum. Back in London, contributing flute and guitar, Kenrick Diggory unbottled the deep rootical psychedelia and sheer awe of Hunting — the Keith-Hudson-versus-Count-Ossie wonder of the world — and Tapes added electronics, a shot of Drum Song… and a giddily intense binghi dub."

The Chi-Lites,Jammys Better,King Jammy's Dub / Dub Store,"Good grief, it’s actually The Chi-Lites, on a John John update of Sleng Teng."
The Chosen Brothers,March Down Babylon,Wackies,"Stone classic Bullwackies (as excursioned by Rhythm & Sound for Burial Mix), sensationally featuring two unreleased dubs, newly extracted from the master reels. Both are equally unmissable but quite different, with contrasting effects: the second dub adds ninety seconds, including whip-dem spring reverb. Drawn from the Selective Showcase LP, the vocal mix is more open and dubwise than the Sing & Shout LP offering, with less keyboards. 
Asked whether it should be mash or march, after some pondering Bullwackies replied: “That’s a good question.”"
The Chosen Brothers,Sing & Shout,Wackies,"A fresh iteration of the mid-eighties LP (itself a compilation of recordings from the previous five years or so), replacing two tracks — Dancing In The Rain and All Things — with their full 12” versions. 
This is a deeply personable, expert, limber blend of roots and lovers, kicking off with an exclusive mix of the deadly Mash Down Babylon; dropping classic, lush, spaced-out Wackies dub science to close; and taking in reworkings of Lickshot, Billie Jean and The Righteous Flames’ I Was Born To Be Loved, along the route.
The moniker ‘Chosen Brothers’ is Lloyd Barnes’ spiritual way of sharing the credit for his solo projects. “Anyone in the studio at the time could be a Chosen Brother,” he says. In this case a full crew includes Sugar Minott and Prince Douglas at the desk; Jah Batta, Milton Henry, Wayne Jarrett and Junior Delahaye all on backing vocals; and such dream-team Bullwackies instrumentalists as Clive Hunt, Jerry Johnson, Fabian Cooke and Ras Menelik."

The Harmonizers,Living In Misery,Earth Sound,"Searingly soulful, bongoman rocksteady recorded at Federal for Sonia Pottinger in 1966 — a hotter-fire alternate take of Go Back Home. Leslie Butler at the piano kicks it off; Jackie Bernard from The Kingstonians wails the gospel truth, drenched in sufferation. Another stone-cold killer from the label. Don’t you murmur, Irma."

The Inturns,Consider Yourself,Pressure Sounds,"Excellent vocal trio sides, produced by Phil Pratt — before the group reverted to its Viceroys moniker."
The Inturns,Nothing Is Impossible,Pressure Sounds,"The earlier Winston Riley cut of Nothing is so deadly — Tubby’s Coconut Oil dub, for crying out loud — it sets this googly up nicely, especially in the extended format. Less urgent; more expansive. Vocals plus dubs, both sides."
The Itals,Rude Boy Train,Waricka,"Lovely, soulful, moody Sir Collins’ production, with the group edging from rocksteady into reggae. Lloyd Charmers vibes up the party, on the flip."

The Maytals,Festival Song 1966 Bam-Bam,BMN / Dub Store,"Beautiful mento sufferers for Ronnie Nasralla in 1966. ‘I am the man who fights for the right, not for the wrong.’ 
People say that’s the first deejay recording on the flip - the wonderful Lord Comic, and his cowboys. ‘Music is real sweet… For your dancing feet.’"
The Maytals & Don Drummond,Coppa,Federal,"Unmissable Maytals, in previously unreleased recordings from 1965. 
Toots and co have this Coppa bang to rights — ‘Stop treating the people unkind’ — even before Don D boots him down the street and the hell out of Dodge."

The Morwells,Crab Race,Burning Sounds,"A swathe of of the duo’s mid-seventies, old-school favourites, like Bit By Bit and their version of The Melodians’ Swing And Dine, corralled by BS in 1977 (by which time Blacka and Bingy Bunny were nine-to-five with Joe Gibbs and The Revolutionaries, and Bingy was planning the Roots Radics with new-Morwell Errol Holt)."

The School Boys,Guilty Of Love,Carifta / Dub Store,"Ace organ-driven rocksteady cut of Love Is A Message, recorded at Treasure Isle on Bunny Lee’s ticket, by youngsters Jacob Miller, Lawrence Weir and Lassive Jones aka Delroy Melody. 
They were going by the name The Young Lads, but Jones remembers Striker’s strong advice: “there are too much Lads group, you boys are going to school, you boys are School Boys.”"
The Shades,She's Gonna Marry Me,Techniques / Dub Store,"The Shades had freshly peeled away from The Techniques, because besides singing Winston Riley wanted to try producing, and Bruce Ruffin needed room… and this is a gem of a calling card.
Sweetly hopeful, rocking rocksteady — with an undertow of foreboding — which Junior Delgado revisited for Dennis Brown, ten years later. 
There’s a killer Marry Me dub on Meditation Dub, judiciously beginning ‘Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss…’"

Featuring Dillinger and Sir Lord Comic at the microphone; Family Man and Carlton Barrett, of course; and Augustus Pablo (on the almighty Words rhythm). The Stingers’ Give Me Power won’t lie down, with a full-length version as Double Power, and two further iterations stitched together with The Ethiopians and a dub of Junior Byles’ Fever, in Operation, to close.
Handsomely presented, too; faithfully minimal."

Tommy McCook,Super Star Disco Rockers,Pressure Sounds,"A deeply satisfying set of meditational roots rockers, lit up by King Tubby. Unmissable for Lambs Bread Herb, a reworking of Yabby You’s Death Trap, with giddily mystical flute and overdubbed steppers drums. 
Says Bunny Lee — “When Tommy join up with Bobby Ellis on trumpet, that is when he develop what we call his ‘far east’ sound, especially when he play flute like on Death Trap. Or sometimes Tommy play clarinet for a different flavour. But mostly he play the tenor sax with that deeper, lower tone, like on Tommy’s Rocking Vibration – hear that big horn there!”"

The studio debut of the mighty Daddy U-Roy in 1969, sparring with Val Bennett over Old Fashioned Way, both of them wigging out like a couple of beboppers, with the ghost of John Holt on the backing tape. “The studio is kinda cloudy,” reports U-Roy — and everyone sounds lit but utterly inspired. Pure vibes.
“My first tune I ever do was Dynamic Fashion Way with Keith Hudson, and then I do Earth’s Rightful Ruler for Scratch. Those tunes didn’t get very far, them sell a couple hundred.”

Sylford Walker,Lamb's Bread,Greensleeves,"Ferociously magnificent, utterly crucial collection of his late-seventies singles, chanting it down like a more blood-and-fire, non-bucolic Burning Spear. The CD adds such unmissable Welton Irie toasts as Black Man Stand Up Pan Foot and Wicked Tumbling. Produced by Glen Brown, mixed by King Tubby. Towering roots reggae, inspired through and through, from start to finish; hotly recommended."

Wareika Hill Sounds,Kumina Mento Rasta,Honest Jon's Records,"Headlong, fierce, banked rasta drumming fit to discombobulate any kind of system, with sweet, jazzy trombone riding it down, bubbling bass driving it home, and all of it classically dubwise."
Wareika Hill Sounds,No More War EP,Honest Jon's Records,"Evoking his time with Count Ossie, four new grounation furies — hypnotic, thunderous, urgent, mystical — with dubwise repeta, funde and bass drums embedding the Light Of Saba man’s t-bone classicism."

Willie Williams,Sweet Home,Dug Out,"Driving Shaka murder, fury and yearning mixed into a perfect marriage of digital and old-school music-making. Bagga Walker and a drum-machine tear up the dub. Complete with rare, ebullient Colarman toast."

Flick Wilson,Ready Fe Dem,Digikiller,"In fine voice on a punchy, dubwise rhythm — maybe the Gifted Roots Band — from the mid-eighties."
Flick Wilson,School Days,Jah Life,"Start-to-finish killer combination of heavier-than-lead Roots Radics rhythms, wild Scientist mixing, and the Flick’s unique singing, often falsetto. Kicking off with an Ain’t Too Proud To Beg."
Flick Wilson,Last Night,Digikiller,"Moody, heavy lovers, detourned by FW’s full-throated falsetto. Ace."
Flick Wilson,Vives,Digikiller,"The fine singer lighting up a vintage Junjo and Roots Radics cast-off. Originally released in 1984 on Kulumi, under the artist name Dandy Lion (with the same typo in the title)."
Flick Wilson,Jah Know,Digikiller,"Marriage proposal on the same rugged Maxfield Avenue rhythm as Van Cliff, Patrick Cool and Nathan Skyers. 
Pull out the stopper, let’s have a whopper."
Flick Wilson,Sparring Partner,Digikiller,Heartically hymning male companionship over the same tough digi rhythm as Nathan Skyers’ Tribute To The Heroes… plus the dub. Previously unreleased.
Delroy Wilson,Ease Up,Pressure Sounds,NA
Delroy Wilson,Baby Don't You Do It,Pressure Sounds,Sturdy Marvin Gaye version. Produced by Phil Pratt and originally released on the Sun Shot label.
Delroy Wilson,Get Ready For Delroy,Clocktower,"Inimitably mixed by King Tubby; The Aggrovators on top form, likewise; rocking horns.
With an excellent Temps, and three lovely Chicago Soul covers. Nobody does reggae-soul better than Delroy.
Aka Sings For I & I."
Delroy Wilson,Worth Your Weight In Gold,Radiation Roots,"Recorded at Chanel One in the early eighties, with Sly & Robbie and proper horns; produced showcase-style by Gussie Clarke, with dubs. The standout is a secret-weapon version of Is It Because I’m Black."
Delroy Wilson,Give Me Your Love,Digikiller,"You can’t lose with Artibella, and this is a decent excursion by the great singer, with a lovely trombone-led version."
Delroy Wilson,Go Away Dream,Pressure Sounds,NA
Winston Edwards,Natty Locks Dub,VP,"Rugged 1974 dub LP replete with Upsetters and Tubby vibes, including the killer Macca Bee, and a nice vocal-with-deejay Love Me With All Your Heart, and featuring fine fleet flute froughout."
Winston Francis,Groovy Situation,Studio One,NA
Winston Harris & The Gladiators,Rub It In,Taw,"A precious Upsetters gem from the Black Ark, circa 1976.
The story goes that only thirty copies were cut, in the day.
Reissued with letter-pressed sleeves and labels.
Hornin’ Sounds killing it three at a time."
Winston Heywood,Backbiting,Black Art,"Lovely singing by the Hombres over a limber, spaced-out Upsetters rhythm you could listen to for hours. The dub attenuates the political reasoning with cruel brilliance."
Winston Samuels,Holding Out,Olive Blossom,"Bumptious, hurting rocksteady from the Be Prepared singer.
Characteristically, Buster sounds a lot less furtive and sorry than Percy Sledge, on the flip."
Winston Smith,Natty Red,Intelitec / Jah Fingers,NA
Yabby You,Deliver Me From My Enemies (Dub Plate Mix),Pressure Sounds,NA
Yabby You,Deeper Roots Part 2,Pressure Sounds,"With the emphasis more on dubs and instrumentals, this round, but including unmissable interjections like Wayne Wade on Man Of The Living, and nuff Prophets. Tubbys such a massive presence ring-side."
Yabby You,Sipping I And I Chalice,Hot City,"Sweet Vivian Jackson roots from 1976. Sunnier, more relaxed and intimate than usual; less of the lightning and thunder."

Yabby You & Michael Prophet Meet The Scientist,At The Dub Station,Dubmusic,"Monster dubs of Yabby You productions of Michael Prophet, Patrick Andy, Alric Forbes and Wayne Wade, by way of King Tubbys. The first-round knockout is pure Shaka fire: an extended version of Gates Of Zion."
Yabby You Meets King Tubby,Walls Of Jerusalem,Pressure Sounds,"One half of this is the LP issued back in the day as Chant Down Babylon Kingdom, on the Nationwide label, split between Yabby You vocals and Tubbys dubs.
On the second platter Pressure Sounds unleashes a deadly tranche of previously unreleased mixes and outtakes, which shed ‘a revealing light on Yabby and Tubby’s working methods, and put the listener right next to the musicians in the studio. They frequently tried out different approaches on alternate takes, bouncing the 4 track tapes from one machine to another to free up tracks for overdubbing. Alongside chatter from the studio musicians, you can hear Yabby (in the vocal booth) communicating with Tubby (over his ‘talkback’ mic) as they shape the finished tracks. Yabby is constantly conferring with “‘bra (brother) Tubbs”, whilst Tubby keeps track of multiple takes of the same song. In the runup to ‘Love Of Jah’ you can really hear the two interacting, as Yabby asks “How that sound?” Tubby, typically understated, replies “Not bad.” Other highlights include “The Man Who Does The Work”, with Yabby singing a beautiful solo vocal with far less harmony accompaniment than on the released version, and an alternate cut of ‘Go To School Jah Jah Children’ with a flute and horn accompaniment (also used on the album’s dub version) and markedly different lyrics.’"

Aiko,Fly With Me,Aloha Got Soul,"The Japanese singer Aiko Sekiguchi teaming up with Dale Senaga in 1979. The pair flew from Hawaii to California to record the backing tracks at A&M Studios, returning with the reels to Commercial Recording Studio in Honolulu, where they added Aiko’s voice and Dale’s synthesizer overdubs (and Aiko resumed her residency at the Oasis nightclub).
Fly With Me is a sexy, exotic floater, crossing Love Unlimited-style two-step  and West Coast AOR. On the flip, Time Machine is jazzy disco steppers, with a cosmic fizz and a light case of the Gloria Gaynors.
More lovely stuff from Aloha Got Soul, moving achingly deep into Japan Blues territory."

Sleekly bumptious, with brilliant musicianship and classy arrangements, dosed with jazz and funk (by way of Kool And The Gang), easily traversing ballads and booty-shakers… just the kind of thing Wayne Henderson was doing across the Pacific with At Home productions, for Side Effect, The McCrarys and co.

Camille Yarbrough,Take Yo' Praise,BGP,"The stunning, mid-seventies song behind Praise You, by this Chicagoan singer and activist, extending the traditions of Nina Simone, Roberta Flack and Gil Scott-Heron to more contemporary voices like Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean.

Betty Davis,Betty Davis,Light In The Attic,"Her stupendous masterwork — the last word in raunchy hard funk, with Anti Love Song, of course, and three decent bonus tracks. Props to Sly Stone’s drummer Greg Errico, and Larry Graham. BD, so BaaaaD."
Betty Davis,The Columbia Years 1968-69,Light In The Attic,"Miles Davis and Teo Macero productions, with Hugh Masekela, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Larry Young and co.
According to LITA, ‘the vibe is intrinsically unique, fresh, and futuristic — jazz heavyweights playing psychedelia, rock, and jazz-fusion long before the term became commonplace.  The songs include Betty originals and covers of classics by Creedence and Cream. The concepts explored on these previously unheard sessions fueled concepts that wouldn’t be fully realized until years later with Miles’ seminal On The Corner.’
All tracks bar two are previously unreleased. New interviews and rare photos."

Eccentric Soul,The Saru Label,Numero,"‘The twentieth volume of our flagship series has all the boxes checked: gun-toting record producers, child stars, rip-offs, ‘The World’s Greatest Bail Bondsman’, soaring falsettos, and a dwindling rust-belt cityscape offering mere glimpses of hope before the record industry escaped for the coasts. Helmed by the O’Jays Bobby Massey, Saru was a creative vortex pulling into Cleveland the best talent in Cuyahoga County — the Out of Sights, the Elements, Pandella Kelly, David Peoples, Sir Stanley, the Ponderosa Twins + 1, Ba-Roz, Bobby Dukes and — of course — The O’Jays.’"
Eddie And Ernie,Time Waits For No One,Cairo,"‘The first LP compilation of songs by the great Eddie and Ernie!  The duo produced tons of great singles throughout the 60s and early 70s.

Refreshing; very limited."
EYE,005,EYE,"Fresh and new, but rough, layered and head-nodding like classic UK street soul, this is the fifth and for us the best-yet installment in Londoner EYE’s excellent, under-the-radar series. 
Slinkily slippery and hard-to-pin-down as usual, but rooted in funk and soul connoisseurship. 
Two-sided this time — boozier, dizzier and more spaced-out on the flip, smudged with echo and effects, and scraps of horns and singing.

Frankie & The Spindles,Count To Ten: The Complete Singles Collection 1968-77,Play Back,"Sweet soul from Baltimore, produced by none other than George Kerr and Bunny Sigler.
The opener Count To Ten was their big hit, grabbing a couple of bars of Smokey Robinson; Candy is treasurably cannibalistic (‘her heart’s made of caramel’ etc); that’s a secret-weapon version of War (What Is It Good For?)."

Weldon Irvine,Cosmic Vortex (Justice Divine),RCA,"His ambitious 1974 breakthrough as leader, superbly mixing funk and jazz improvisation on a major-label recording budget, with strong political and spiritual themes, even a nod to the Duke."

Featuring a twelve-minute version of Marva Whitney’s It’s My Thing, by way of Jimi Hendrix, The Meters and Kool & The Gang.
A coup even by Now Again standards — there are only two extant copies of the King test pressing — the music has been remastered for vinyl from the original two-track tape, and comes in a heavyweight sleeve, with a 12-page booklet of excellent notes and exclusive photos."

Etta James,Tell Mama,4 Men With Beards,"Perhaps her greatest LP, recorded at FAME in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, with Rick Hall and the gang, released by Cadet in 1968. A handful of belters, a couple of Don Covay songs, excellent interpretations of Steal Away and Otis’ Security… the marvellously sympathetic musicianship of Carl Banks, Roger Hawkins, Barry Beckett and co… and the almighty I’d Rather Go Blind."
James Pants,The Electric Finger 2,Liger Vision Media,"Mashing up classic electro hip hop, post-punk, two-step soul, rare boogie, a little Dutch psych, cosmic electronic library music, booty-bass, and jacking acid classics, Pants-style, for starters."

Biggie pitched it down and hard-boiled it, on Ready To Die…. Digital Underground snuck it into Doowutchyalike…

La Vice & Co.,Two Sisters From Baghdad,Jazzman,"The idea was for this record to be sold at the door of a theatrical show at Detroit’s Bethel A.M.E. church. The show bombed, lasting just two weeks; and with only a handful of copies punted, most of the reminder were later destroyed in a basement flood. 
It’s intriguing, youthful, left-field gospel-soul. A bit odd. The deep funk of Thoughs Were The Days is the coup de grâce.
Well-presented, with notes drawing on new interviews with creative mainstays E.J. Garrison and Rhodia McAdoo.
Don’t hang about."

Leonard Chin,What More Can I Say,Pepite,"A gorgeous crossing of lovers rock, jazz-funk and soul, originally out in 1982 on Sanity Records, over in Chapel Market, Islington.

Liquid Liquid,Optimo,99 Records,NA
Liquid Liquid,"Liquid Idiot, Idiot Orchestra",Superior Viaduct,"In truth this is just prior to the formation of Liquid Liquid, in 1981. Like a no-wave, Saturnian version of Raymond Scott’s big band. The punks at the London Musicians Collective would have loved them.
LI played various NYC lofts and clubs, including Tier 3, Mudd Club and CBGB. Audience members were encouraged to bring their own instruments along. Idiot Orchestra was an offshoot involving more than a dozen players  — clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, violin, cello, synth, bass, marimba and drums. 
With a fanzine featuring rare photos and a new interview with Richard McGuire."

Loko Jazz Band,John Ndons,Matata,NA
Loma,"Volume Three: Sad, Sad Feeling 1964-68",Future Days Recordings,"Celebrating the more sophisticated, uptown productions on the label, mostly cut in New York under the supervision of soul royalty like Jerry Ragovoy, Van McCoy, George Kerr and Richard Tee. Stunners like Linda Jones’ Hypnotized and Bobby Freeman’s spooky Shadow Of Your Love; rare Realistics, Bobby Reed, Mary Lee Whitney, and Tommy Starr; and several unreleased titles, including a gem from Bob & Earl, Just One Look In Your Eyes."
Loma,Volume Four: Sweeter Than Sweet Things 1964-68,Future Days Recordings,"Loma was set up by Bob Krasnow at an address on Burbank in LA, overlooking Loma Avenue at the back. (He left in 1966 to set up Kama Sutra/Buddha, promptly signing Captain Beefheart’s Safe As Milk.) 
Early dabblings in R&B were a hangover from Krasnow’s time at King — and there were one-aways like Kim Fowley’s The Belfast Gipsies —  but Loma is best characterised as a Warners subsidiary, for four years expertly trained on the burgeoning soul singles market, especially rich in Northern Soul. 
The final volume of this excellent retrospective series offers plenty of unreleased material, including stars like Linda Jones and The Mighty Hannibal, dancers like The Marvellos’ I Need You and The Invincibles’ Heartstrings, and such classy exemplars of the Ragovoy-styled uptown sound as Carl Hall and Ben Aiken."

Lou Courtney,I’m In Need of Love,Soul Brother,"From 1974, featuring knockout rare groove like I Don’t Need Nobody Else and What Do You Want Me To Do. 
Limber, feeling and introspective, with full horns and strings setting fine songs and frankly soulful singing.
Lou came through in Detroit as a writer and producer with Barbara Lewis, before signing in his own right to Epic, via the Rags label run by legendary producer Jerry Ragovoy. Hereafter he was briefly a member of The Fifth Dimension.
One of the greatest of all modern soul albums. "

With the classic Mellow Mellow Right On, as sampled across the board, from Massive Attack to Common."
Luv You Madly Orchestra,Rocket Rock,Salsoul,"Utterly brilliant, spaced-out, jazzy, left-field disco, mixed by Walter Gibbons.
Moon Maiden, on the flip, is a stupendous Duke Ellington cover: ‘almost nine minutes of frantic, trippy disco eccentricity with soaring strings, odd analogue synth frequencies and spooky vocals flowing in and out… driven along by wooden blocks, cowbells and that insistent bass-line.’ 
Only available previously as a run of promos; never fully released till now."

‘This heavy script… I could relate with a lot of it… It allowed me to get past the glitter of the drug scene and go to the depth of it — allowing a little bit of the sparkle and the highlights lyrically, but always with a moral to that.’

Melba Moore,Standing Right Here,Buddah,"Superb disco boogie. A deeply soulful song, expertly sung. Killer, bare-bones break-downs, soaring strings, resplendent horns, with composers McFadden and Whitehead rocking the controls.

The Starship Orchestra lineup is amazing: Pharoah Sanders, Bobby Lyle, Gary Bartz, Jean Carn etc etc etc. Eleanor Mills — Stephanie’s sister — is an outstanding singer in best Starship traditions; there’s an ace Brazilian version of Herbie’s Butterfly; tough and funky, Captain Connors is the standout."

Same Plunky as on Strata East and the recent Ndikho Xaba LP. Gotta be Phunky with Plunky."
Pretty Purdie,Purdie Good,BGP,"From 1971, during the great funky drummer’s time as Aretha’s musical director. He’d also played for James Brown — on It’s A Man’s Man’s World — and this kicks off with a superbad Cold Sweat. With standout contributions from Harold Wheeler on electric keys, and guitarist Ted Dunbar."
Pretty Purdie,Shaft,BGP,"A tentet — half brass — also featuring Houston Person, and the electric keys of Neal Creque, lately of Grant Green’s band. Arranged by Fatback Band trumpeter Gerry Thomas — a old spar of Purdie from Soul Emissaries days — the title track sets the agenda: punchy, vibesing, loaded with horns; jet-propelled by Purdie."

Highlights include the funky I’ll Be Damned, a turbo-hustle version of Respect, and best of all the wonderful What Am I Gonna Do. (You’re gonna re-work Young Hearts Run Free, that’s what.)"
Wendy Rene,After Laughter Comes Tears: Complete Stax-Volt Singles And Rarities 1964-65,Light In The Attic,"Magnificent review of this southern soul legend lately versioned by Alicia Keys and sampled by the Wu Tang Clan. With Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper and co. Raw and alive, the real thing; warmly recommended. Fab."
Respect,Aretha's Influences And Inspiration,Ace,"A testament to the impeccable taste of the greatest soul singer of all time — mostly big names and classics, rounded off by gospel giant Clara Ward, and the song Aretha sang at her funeral."
Retta Young,Young And Restless,Expansion,"A straight reissue of this quality mid-seventies soul LP, co-produced by old-man Al Goodman from The Moments. The opener is killer, love-starved, spaced-out disco, with tasty effects; My Love Is On His Way is ace, move-on-up Northern; That’s How Some Men Are amongst several classy ballads, worth savouring."
Jeannie Reynolds,"Cherries, Bananas And Other Fine Things",Reel Music,"Her first album, from 1976, with the rare groove classic The Fruit Song, and four bonus tracks, including her biggest hit, The Phone’s Been Jumping All Day.

Richard Marks,Never Satisfied,Now Again,"A Now Again labour of love: the complete works of this legendary guitarist-singer-songwriter from Atlanta. His earliest work for the Tuska label, through his more mature releases for Shout, and smaller regional labels like Note, Free Spirit and RSC, at the most subterranean and fertile interface of Southern soul and funk. CD presented in a fifty-six-page, saddle-stitched book, with extensive essays on Marks’ career and never-before-seen photos and ephemera. Great stuff."
Minnie Riperton,Perfect Angel,Universal,"Cor. The classic 1975 LP — plus a second, full disc, mixed by John Morales, with several much-extended, jamming alternate versions, and Take A Little Trip as a duet with Stevie Wonder, an acoustic Seeing You This Way, an alternate Lovin’ You (with backing by Wonderlove), and Don’t Let Anyone Bring You Down, with Wonder playing most of the instruments, alongside Hubert Laws on flute."

Arthur Russell,Corn,Audika,"The sequel to Calling Out Of Context; another precious extraction from Arthur’s original, completed 1/4” tape masters. 
Russell himself compiled this material thirty years ago, on three separate test pressings, labelled El Dinosaur, Indian Ocean and Untitled: five brilliant alternate versions of key works — including This Is How We Walk On The Moon — and four offerings new to the world, triumphantly culminating in the rapt, restless Ocean Movie. Wonderful."
Arthur Russell,Instrumentals,Audika,"The first volume is a mid-seventies masterpiece, Americana touching on Copeland, Ives, and Brian Wilson, with AR ‘re-awakened to the bright-sound and magical qualities of the bubblegum and easy-listening currents in American popular music.’ Volume 2 is a moving, pastoral orchestral work, conducted here by Julius Eastman. Also included are two of Arthur’s most elusive compositions, recorded live in 1975: Reach One is a minimal, hypnotic ambient soundscape for two Fender Rhodes pianos; Sketch For Face Of Helen commemorates his colloborations with Arnold Dreyblatt, recorded with a keyboard, tone generator and — with echoes of Moondog — recordings of a tugboat rumbling across the waters of the Hudson River."

Classic Philly Soul, loaded with Gwen Guthrie compositions, including great, soulful dancers like Love, Don’t You Go Through No Changes On Me, a massive Northern favourite.
This reissue includes a new interview with Kathy Sledge, and adds ten bonus tracks to the original LP tracklisting, gathering the group’s remaining singles on Atco and Cotillion between 1973 and 1976, most of which have never been on CD before: stuff like the UK hit Mama Never Told Me, and the Bobby Eli productions Thank You For Today and Cream Of The Crop."

Sly Stone,"Listen To The Voices: In The Studio, 1965-70",Kent,NA
Sly Stone,Recorded In San Francisco 1964-67,Sculpture,"Live recordings, demos, and the first Sly & The Family Stone single — some funked-up Otis for Loadstone in 1967 — including doses of Herbie, James Brown, blues, MOR balladeering and hippie pop. Highlights are the wigged-out spoken-word version of Deck Of Cards (to run alongside Prince Far I) and the raw funk of Rock Dirge, a B-boy secret weapon to close."
Sly's Stone Flower,I'm Just Like You (1969-70),Light In The Attic,"Truly pioneering electro-funk — treated, lo-fi, minimal, fundamentally desolate — this long overdue compilation of Sly’s own Stone Flower label runs the five 45s alongside ten previously unissued cuts, all newly remastered from the original tapes. The missing link between the rocky, soulful Stand! and the dark, ticking, overdubbed sound of There’s A Riot Going On, his masterpiece.

Bettye Swann,Make Me Yours,Money Records,"Soul queen in waiting, Betty Jean Champion moved from rural Louisiana to California in 1963, aged nineteen, to chase her dream.

The Deirdre Wilson Tabac,The Deirdre Wilson Tabac,Be With Records,"A baroque, tripping blend of funk, jazz and soulful pop — with all the complex grooves, thrilling breaks and ethereal weirdness of the Rotary Connection — recorded in Philadelphia in 1969, by Deirdre Wilson, Stu Freeman (from a garage band called the Mushrooms) and Barbara Payne (formerly with the James Brown Revue). 
The funky version of Get Back was a big headz tune, back in the day; but the crucial cut is surely the  jazz dancer I Can’t Keep From Cryin’ Sometimes, with its soulful, haunting vocals, swinging hammond organ and stabbing horns."
The Dells,The Dells Sing Dionne Warwicke's Greatest Hits,Dusty Groove,"Alternatively — Terry Callier Boys Tear Up Bacharach And David With Charles Stepney At The Desk And Phil Upchurch, The Chess Strings And The Pharoahs All On Fire. Great, showy soul music from 1972."
The Devils,The X-Sorcist,Get On Down,"From 1974, spinning off the Friedkin film into a psych-funk marriage of eerie experimental effects and blistering instrumental badness, featuring Fred Wesley on ARP synthesizer, Maceo Parker on alto saxophone, and production from the Godfather.

The Impressions,Times Have Changed,Love Vinyl,"Excellent LP from early 1972, with Curtis’ falsetto giving way to Leroy Hutson’s tenor in the group, though Mayfield still produces and arranges, and writes most of the songs. Stop The War is on the money; there’s a decent Marvin cover, deftly arranged by Hutson, who composed This Love For Real; a lush Our Love Goes On And On, prefiguring the Gladys Knight interpretation; and Need To Belong is beautifully reclaimed from Jerry Butler and Laura Lee.

It was recorded in 1972 by Rudy Van Gelder, at the local club that gave the band their name, and originally out in 1972 on Eastbound Records, but you never see it."
The Notations,Still Here 1967-1973,Numero,"Gorgeous, unheralded, sweet soul from Chicago.
School-friends Clifford Curry and LaSalle Matthews started the group in 1965, with Walter Jones and Robert Thomas, all in for the long haul. They waited till 1970 for a hit — I’m Still Here, produced by Syl Johnson for Twinight — and had to ride out the label’s demise before signing to Curtom’s new Gemigo imprint in late 1973. (Super People was 1975.)
Unmistakably Chicagoan and stamped by Curtis, classically schooled but on the cusp… with its roots in the chivalric harmonies of doowop, its bad self in dapperly distraught r&b balladry, and its eye on the new social consciousness of soul and funk. 
Typical Numero loveliness."

Ultra High Frequencies,The Chicago Party,Numero,"Guaranteed to put a beam on your bean and a glide in your stride, the DVD here compiles moments from a local 1982 TV show, broadcast live from a club called The CopHerBox. It’s pleasurable enough just watching people get down so naturally, in a real-life club… but you also get ventriloquists, contortionists, body-builders, impersonators, ‘the full-figured ladies fashion show’, comedy sketches, android group-dancing to techno, rubber chickens… and bands like Universal Togetherness miming to their latest records. There’s also a mini-documentary, complete with Phil Cohran section; and twenty-three full musical performances. (Finally the Dingwalls posse gets a glimpse of Luba Raushiek in action.) 
The CD and vinyls are culled from a trove of self-released 45s and small-time twelves; a die-cut cathode-ray jacket and six in-package stills are your tickets and souvenirs.

Around that era, it’s like jazz, funk, and disco mixed together… you get this unique sound… bands like Light Of The World and Hi-Tension… This could almost be British from that era. It’s my album of the week’ (Gilles Peterson)."

Van Jones,Time Has Made Me New,Everland,"It’s a shame that originals of this fine soul and boogie LP are so hard to find.
The Chic-style opener well and truly skewers VJ at the receiving end of an extended feminist slagging from his backing vocalists. The title track is an ace, gloopy, characteristically sincere ballad. She’s A FFFF gallantly stands up for those of us who are fine, foxy, freaky and fairly fat. Shake those mighty cheeks, comrades."

Vicky D,This Beat Is Mine,SAM,"The bonafide-classic, early-eighties Boogie monster and gold-plated party-starter, produced by Gary Turnier from Gary’s Gang and Andre Booth from North End."
The Voices Of East Harlem,Can You Feel It,Just Sunshine,"Arranged and produced by Leroy Hutson, who co-wrote all the songs, and part engineered at Curtom. The Voices’ best album, brimming with good vibes, bubbling grooves, great singing, political resistance."
The Voices Of East Harlem,The Voices Of East Harlem,Just Sunshine,"From 1973, stepping outside the church under the wing of Leroy Hutson and Curtis Mayfield, this is a soul masterpiece, with Cashing In, Wanted Dead Or Alive and the rest. 
A must."

Featuring the sublime Last Night Changed It All (I Really Had A Ball) — immortal bump’n'hustle from a woman’s point of view, beloved throughout the Zulu Nation as a queen amongst Ultimate Breaks & Beats, and sampled by De La Soul, BDP, Public Enemy, Guru, The Coup… the lot.
